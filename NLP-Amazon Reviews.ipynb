      "Nearly a week was spent looking through feature sets, reading reviews, and considering price points when I finally decided on the Breadman Ultimate T2200C. That decision was made just under a year ago. Waiting a year to leave my review was intentional; I understand the draw of new, shiny toys and in all the excitement, it's easy to lead prospective buyer's astray with incomplete reviews. That said, let's get started.Being a bread making novice, I found the included instructional video to be invaluable, though it might have been prudent to include a DVD as opposed to VHS tape, considering current technology trends. Watching it once was enough to get started making my first perfect loaf of bread. It showed precisely how to add the ingredients, gave some tips for better bread making, and went over the general functions of the machine.Things were glorious for the first few months, the aroma of fresh bread wafting through the house. Making, on average, one to two loaves per week, I became known as the bread lady. People were coming from far and wide to sample my goods. (OK, maybe not far *and* wide, but I did get nick-named the bread lady.)Then, the problems started...One morning while some dough was kneading, I heard a loud clang and suddenly it sounded as though bombs were going off in my kitchen. Springing up from my office chair and sprinting to the kitchen, I saw that the bread pan had come loose and the machine was jostling itself perilously close to my counter's edge.After pausing the machine, repositioning it, and pressing the bread pan back in place, all seemed well again. Too bad it didn't stay that way for long. Future incidents increased and soon, the bread pan refused to properly lock in place. This significantly impacted the amount of bread I made, which dropped down to one to two loaves *per month*. A year later, the bread pan staying in place is truly a hit or miss.With Thanksgiving nearing, I decided it would be nice to have fresh bread with our turkey. The Breadman decided otherwise. I plugged in the machine and nothing happened. The beep of mechanical life was absent and the screen was totally blank. I tried pressing buttons and followed the instructions in the manual (which are really vague when it comes to this problem), yet nothing. (This wasn't the first time, either. Though, I should be clear, the previous cases were few, sporadic and non-disruptive.)The day before Thanksgiving and my bread machine refused to even acknowledge the presence of electricity -- I was beside myself. Many people were promised fresh bread and I surely wasn't about to touch a conventional oven.  My only recourse was to head out into holiday traffic and snag a $40 deal from Wal-Mart -- nowhere near the same quality of bread, unfortunately.Suddenly, after allowing it to sit unplugged for another three days, it sprang back to life. Unfortunately, it did so with a customer service rep on the phone and it left me with a bit of egg on my face. No matter, I discussed the issue of the unstable bread pan and she gave me some tips. Basically, she said it was my fault - or rather, my bread dough's fault. Funny, considering my bread dough hasn't changed *at all* (I use the exact same recipe each time) in the year I've been using the bread machine.At the end of the day, the bread machine still works, but I don't know for how long, the bread pan is unstable, and the customer service was unable to do anything for me after the 10 minute wait to speak with a human. One would think that a year's use from a bread machine that costs $xx is a pretty good value, but it's not the case. By my calculations, when I consider the cost of the machine, ingredients and the number of loaves I've made, it comes out to be just under $10/loaf. Had I known that was the value I'd be getting, I'd have stuck with store bought for $3/loaf.Although the machine makes absolutely beautiful bread, the cost versus quality just doesn't stand up to the test of time. If you plan to make a number of fancy breads, need a machine that produces amazing baking results, or can justify the high cost per loaf, this is a great tool. But be aware that it may not stand up to the test of time or the wear and tear.\n",

I debated between a 12-Quart and 16-Quart and looked at a few in stores to get an idea of the size difference. I probably would have been OK with just a 12-Quart but I'm glad that I got a 16-Quart because it has plenty of room.I read reviews of several products and this one had great reviews. As others have said, it has a nice solid base and does not burn food on the bottom. Another thing I really like is that it does not have rivets. I kept reading that in other reviews and had to look-up what that meant. So in case you're not a cookware expert either, rivets are when the handles are bolted to the pot and you have those little round fasteners on the inside of the pot. The reason I don't like rivets is that food tends to get stuck in them.The instructions do say that it's dishwasher safe, they also say it may lose it's shininess after dishwashing. I haven't put mine through the dishwasher yet. I would have to remove the top rack of the dishwasher to be able to fit it. Plus, I love how shiny it is!I definitely recommend it!\n",

This not only makes the cups slightly harder to hold; they feel unbalanced when full.The rubber coverings on the handles will melt or burn if the cups are used to heat liquid ingredients on the stove, which is one of the main advantages of sturdy metal measuring cups.The cups could be used more flexibly if there were also metal markings on the sides, to divide the one cup into halves, thirds, and quarters, and the half cup into quarters. This would enable you to pre-measure, say, two different quarter cups of ingredients accurately without having to get out yet another measuring cup from some other set.Overall, it's not a bad set of measuring cups but I am glad I already have a burner-proof set with longer handles, plus plastic four-cup and two-cup measuring cups.\n",

Since I'd already tried the other, I chose this one as it's replacement. And, bonus, it's a dollar less.Compared to the other, the two main differences are that this one doesn't have as flashy a handle (less embellishment) and the connection between the handle and spade is not as flexible.The serrated edges make cutting cakes and pies easy and it is plenty flexible enough to slide easily under the piece of dessert and pull it out for serving.\n",

I've owned them for about 6 years and use them about once or twice a month. The handles may look like they are glued on but I believe it is an electrical weld, or at least that is what a mechanic told me he thought it was.I would not consider them to be flimsy or light weight, but they are not heavy duty either. I consider them to be basic middle of the road measuring cups. Worth what I paid. To me these are worth about $8 to $10 but not much more.I am careful with stainless steel, as some manufacturers take short cuts and use low quality ingredients in their stainless (you will see pitting if it's low quality or poorly made). I see nothing that would indicate this is low quality stainless steel. It is highly polished and has no pitting. I'm surprised at the quality since they are made in China and due to so many Chinese manufacturers making low quality (even dangerous or toxic) products I usually don't buy or use anything made in China. But, on close inspection I am happy with the quality of these cups.If I were a professional baker or if I expected to use my measuring cups every day I would invest in a better set that are one piece (the handles are not welded on but are part of the cup) since that would make them very strong. Like theseAmco Advanced Performance Measuring Cup Set. Or I'd get the kind that have the handles riveted on, like theseAll-Clad Stainless Measuring Cup Set. But again, these Amco Basic's are just fine for my purposes (for the average cook), and I don't want to spend $25 to $50 on measuring cups (and many cannot afford that).My only wish is that they had a 1/8 cup to make it a set of 5.

I've bought quite a few peelers in my lifetime, always searching for that \"perfect\" peeler. Yes, this is the best peeler I've owned so far, altho' this is the only one bought online. Yes, it's very sharp and quick. Maybe it's due to my age (not telling) or my small hands, but I yet find it very awkward to hold a potato in my hand and peel each end and side of the potato using this peeler without nearly slicing a portion of my hand or fingers in the process. One has to hold a potato \"just so\" in order to peel the potato properly. If not careful, the potato will slip out of your hand or you will slice the side of your thumb, finger or palm. I've actually sliced myself once and \"almost\" a few times too many since I've had this peeler, although I had never had any issues with any other peeler. After 2 years, it's still too stressful peeling a potato with this type peeler. So for me, back to the pursuit of the perfect peeler I go. . . .\n",

      "I bought this machine many years ago. My family thought I was nuts to spend so much money on an ice cream machine. And I admit, I was wondering at first if I had gone a bit overboard myself. But I have never regretted purchasing it ever since.This machine is a joy to use and makes making your own homemade ice cream a breeze. You mix the ingredients, put them in the machine, set the timer, and start it up. In about 30 minutes you have ice cream. If you are like me, you have ice cream made from organic ingredients.Cleanup is a little tricky. The big plus is that the bowl is smooth, rounded stainless steel--very easy to get clean and sanitary. The minus is that the bowl is integrated with the body of the machine, so you can't take it out. The plus side of that integration, however, is that there are no cracks or seams where particles can linger and rot, so I don't mind this one drawback.The machine doesn't make a lot of ice cream at a time, and the ice cream comes out pretty soft when it is done. You need to let it sit in your freezer to harden it up a bit. (I think it is possible to leave the ice cream in the machine with just the compressor running, but I haven't tried that.)However, if you want more ice cream, you can make one batch after another sequentially, and if you are making the same flavor, you don't need to clean the machine in between batches.I personally love this machine because my favorite ice cream flavor is peppermint, but I can't get it commercially except during the winter (where the robins bask). With this machine, I've developed my own delicious peppermint ice cream recipe, so I can enjoy its refreshing flavor any time of year. Oh, and my own green tea ice cream recipe beats any commercial green tea ice cream.If you are looking for good recipes for this machine, tryBen & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream & Dessert Book, which is the best ice cream recipe book I've used. One warning is that many of these recipes use raw eggs. If you don't want to use raw eggs in your ice cream, you can make a cooked custard-style ice cream, or use the no-egg recipes fromThe Ultimate Ice Cream Book : Over 500 Ice Creams, Sorbets, Granitas, Drinks, And More.\n",

      "First up, you want a measuring cup to be accurate.  So I put the 1 cup on myOXO Scaleand filled it with water until it looked even with the top (yes, this is a bit hard to do because of the meniscus that forms with water, but I did my best to get it even).  Then looked at the display: 240 grams.  And amazingly that's the exact definition of a cup of water:  240 ml (for water, 1ml weighs 1 gram)But while doing that I noticed my first minor issue with these:  the top of the 1 cup is not level with the bottom.  So when the cup is sitting on a flat surface the top is at a slight angle.  It's subtle and unlikely to be a problem in most cases, but it seems less than ideal.Quality wise these are great, made from a single, hefty piece of metal with a nice handle.My other minor gripe is that the hook on the end of each and the ring that they all clip to is ugly and annoying.  Why do your measuring cups need to clip together?  The first thing I did was throw the ring in the back of the bottom drawer, never to be seen again.So, nearly perfect but they lose a star for a few minor issues.\n",

      "I bought this little pot after I tasted perked coffee at a private, catered brunch.  The caterer had one of those big, cheap old-fashioned percolators.  I poured a cup, took a sip and OMG!  That was the BEST cup of coffee I have ever had!  I asked him if it was the brand of coffee he was using and he said no, that it was just regular coffee but that the percolator made a difference.Anyway, I bought the Farberware 4-cup since I would be making coffee for myself only most mornings.  I've been  using it for about 9 months.  Well, this morning I plug it up and nothing happens.  I check the connections and they seem to be ok.  I unplug the cord from the pot and replug, nothing.  So then I had to dump out the water and coffee.  After examining the pot, I heard something jingling inside.  I looked at the bottom and noticed that one of the little metal prongs where the plug plugs into the pot was gone.  It's inside the bottom of the damn pot!  Evidently those prongs deteriorate and then break off.I want to get the 4-cup repaired, but I will probably have to spend the same as it would cost to buy a new one.  This doesn't seem cost effective to me.  Plus, if Farberware is cutting corners using cheaper parts, then they should lower the cost of the pot!What I did like about this pot is that it heated very quickly.  It took about 2 minutes to brew 4 cups.  The coffee tasted fine.  The one drawback is that the pot does not turn off.  You MUST unplug it immediately after you pour (if you have memory lapses).  If you forget to unplug it, the pot will continue to heat and burn up all residue left inside.Oh, one more thing.  If you use regular ground store-bought coffee, you will have \"mud\" at the bottom of your cup.  You would probably need to grind your own beans more coarsely to eliminate the mud or use a paper coffee filter inside the basket.  I just tolerate the mud.\n",

      "My first popcorn popper survived over ten years of twice-a-week popping until my 10-yr-old dropped the lid and broke it.  When I first read about the Stir Crazy, I thought it was a gimmick.  One more thing to break - but I ordered one anyway because there wasn't much selection.  What a great move!  Microwave popcorn is convenient, but it has a tendency to burn if you don't watch it.  The Stir Crazy is great.  Dribble some oil in, add my favorite &quot;premium&quot; popcorn, plug it in, and pretty much every kernel pops every time.  Like others, I leave the top open to let the steam escape so that the popcorn is more tender - I flip and empty the popper as soon as the popping stops for the same reason - and the results are reliably great.  Use that idle microwave to melt the butter.  A quick swirl with the OXO Nylon Palm Soap Brush, and the parts are clean.  By the way, the revolving arm does wear off a circle of the non-stick stuff, but that's what the raised ring is supposed to do (it sacrifices itself to protect the main popping surface)!So, I started skeptical, sad to have lost my reliable popper, but there's no looking back for me.\n",

I'm pretty new in the kitchen so I'm just learning what works for me and what doesn't.The SteeL product line is nice. I don't have a bad thing to say about them.

But after reading the reviews here I purchased it and this morning gave it a try. The blade feels kind of flimsy and is very thin. It bends easily and if you are too rough with it I believe it would permanently crease without much effort. However, for flipping pancakes and eggs it is perfect! It slides under the pancakes with no bulldozing and after the flip the pancake looks perfect.If I'm flipping hamburgers I'll use the SteeL spatula but for delicate breakfast foods like eggs and pancakes the Good Grips Flexible Spatula the right tool for the job.\n",

They are sturdy, heavy aluminum and the handles make it so much easier to handle and arrange hot pans in the oven than the older pans without handles. Nordic Ware made excellent products thirty years ago when I bought my first full-sized Bundt pan, and they continue to make excellent products today. And they're made in the USA!I had been avoiding baking my favorite Bundt-style cakes because the cakes were simply too large to use up in a reasonable amount of time. Now with two of these mini-pans I can make one recipe, dividing the batter evenly between them and end up with one small cake to freeze or give away and another for immediate use. Perfect! It wouldn't be difficult to halve a recipe to make only enough batter for one cake as an alternative.The first cake I tried baking in these was a chocolate pound cake (check verybestbaking.com and search for Rich Chocolate Pound Cake if you'd like the recipe) and they came out beautifully. The cakes released from the pans easily without damage after cooling and looked terrific. Just remember to adjust the baking times to account for less batter.

      "This is a *nice* set of measuring cups. They are sturdy, well made, and feel good in your hands. Sometimes when I use the more-flimsy plastic ones, I feel like the cup might snap back and spring a cup of flour into the air (if that makes any sense at all), but these feel solid and do a great job.I've read some of the reviews stating that the handles were flimsy on these, but on the set we got, the handles were very firm and solid, easily standing up to any weight in the cups.The only issue is no 1/8th of a cup, which is actually something we regularly use (yes, I know it's two tablespoons, but it's nice to have that measure...)I'm actually going to get a set for the garden. I believe these will stand up to the ultra-humid Florida environment, and be perfect for scooping up potting soil, mulch, and other gardening \"ingredients\" I mix together out back. It would be nice to have a solid set of different sized scoops and cups especially for the garden and for outdoor use.Highly recommended as a big step up from flimsy plastic stuff we've been junking up the kitchen cabinets with.\n",

      "Please note that I have several Henckel knives that I really like, so this is definitely not a anti-Henckel biased review.There is really only one problem with this knife - the blade is way too thick.  If there's only one problem - then why do I give it only one star?  Well, this one problem completely ruins this knife.  The 'eversharp' name I'm sure refers to the fact that the serrations are not the standard \"wave pattern\" you'd see on most bread knives. Instead, each serration has several smaller serrations and spikes built in. I know that this is supposed to ensure that the knife will never end up dull - but in the process it makes it horrible at doing any kind of delicate cutting. Plus, the blade is not flexible in any way due to the extreme thickness. Unless you are cutting the sturdiest bread out there, you'll crush it while trying to slice with this blade. Forget about cutting any kind of soft bread or pastry. I've found that some of our cheap steak knives work far better than this knife.I've come to the conclusion that this knife is horrible after comparing it to two other bread knives I now own. The first was a Paderno (small Canadian company) that we got for our wedding, and the second was a Global bought from Amazon. Both are considerably more expensive than this knife, but there are other, more economical options out there that are still far better. You want to find a nice, thin blade with even and sharp serrations. If you're looking to stay in this price range, you won't find anything forged - these will all be stamped or laser cut - but that's fine - the bread knife doesn't need to be strong like your chef's knife.Pros:-CheapCons:-Mashes your bread while it cuts-Hard to get started through crusts due to blade thickness-The 'spiky' serrations are dangerous to your fingers (think many tiny needles along the blade) - they tend to nick you easily - but they are useless for their intended purpose of cutting bread.Suggestion: Steer clear. If you can afford it, get a Global (or even a better Henckel). Otherwise, look for a the thin stamped blade.\n",

The wok is well made but it doesn't get hot enough on my American gas stove.  I tried turning the ring upside down but that didn't work.  I have to remove the burner grill to do it and then the ring slides around on the stove and the wok is in contact with the burner, not the ring, and it rocks around.  No good.  It's a high quality piece of cookware that just doesn't work on my stove.  I guess eventually I'll try the flat bottomed 14 inch wok as is recommended by many for American stoves.  I'm beginning the think the real problem is the stove just won't give enough heat and no wok will work very well.

      "I recently replaced an Orville Redenbacher Popcorn Popper which I owned for over a year with this Stir Crazy unit. Quite honestly, both poppers are so similar that they might be interchangeable except for their logos.Operation is easy. Plug the Stir Crazy into an electric socket, pour in the popping oil, add the popcorn, put on the lid on, and watch the magic happen. An arm rotates at the bottom of the popper which distributes the popcorn and effectively eliminates the need to shake the popcorn in hot oil. If you use the butter dispenser, the popcorn will be evenly coated with butter without getting soggy or excessively greasy.The unit is easy to clean after it has presumably cooled down after being unplugged. It is not submersible so I use dampened paper towels to clean and dry the unit. The bowl and lid need to be hand washed in warm, soapy water and air or hand dried.My only issue with this unit and my old Redenbacher popper is the plastic bowl. Because they are made of a hard plastic the bowls seem to be predisposed to hairline cracks. This unit's bowl already shows fracturing as did my old popper. The bowl just isn't particularly durable even when it is gently hand washed. This might not be a huge issue if the bowl wasn't essential to operation. While for me this isn't a deal breaker because this popper makes really good popcorn, it would be nice if they could come up with a sturdier bowl.Overall, this is a nice popper that is reasonably priced.\n",

After working with so many different types, you do tend to get a feel for the types  that work the best and wind up standing the test of time.  OXO's Good Grips Measuring Cups are stainless steel with soft grip plastic handle with the measurement of the cup printed on the top of the handle.  The set comes with 4 different measurement cups, sizes 1 Cup, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4.  All four attach to a sturdy plastic ring.Sturdy and easy to clean, these are a fantastic addition to our kitchen.  Unlike plastic sets that tend to stain over time, these do not take on the coloring of the foodstuffs measured out--even tomato based items and turmeric.  While we do not own a dishwasher, these are supposedly dishwasher safe with measurement labels that will not rub off after heavy use.  Whether these numerical labels will last over time remains to be seen.  So far, so good.  The deep cups allow for easy scooping--it's easier to get the full amount in one go than it is when the cup is shallow.What we really love is the ability to hang  these cups up by their main ring.  We can detach each cup in turn and put them back on without opening the ring or pulling off every measuring  cup.  The cups don't come off super easy, but that's a plus since you don't want to dislodge all the cups accidentally. My only real complaint may be that the set does not come with a 3/4 size measurement--though often these days it's hard to find a set that does.A sturdy and practical product for everyday kitchen measuring.Happy cooking! ^_^ Shanshad\n",

      "I bought this to replace my Anolon 16 qt. stock pot, which I bought in 2008. It had pitted in several places, to the point that there was a patch of aluminum showing through the stainless steel bottom. I didn't want aluminum in my food, so after I determined that it would take 6 weeks to obtain action on the &#34;limited lifetime warranty&#34; and the pot wasn't available anymore, I decided to try this one, which is sold by the same company. I used it once to make stock and it pitted and discolored after the first use, so it had to go back for a refund. It was also lighter weight than the Anolon one, didn't heat as quickly, and it took a higher heat setting to maintain the simmer at the right level to make good stock. I am surprised at the number of high marks given by other reviewers. In addition, the Anolon pot had the handles bolted onto the sides and lid and this one had thin stainless steel loops spot welded on, so I was very worried that one of the handles on the side would come off while I was lifting a pot full of hot stock and burn myself. I never had that problem with the Anolon pot, and I am sorry I have to replace it at this time.After I returned this pot, I bought a Tramontina 16 qt. stock pot and had to return it, too, as it was already pitted on the bottom, right out of the package. It also was lighter in weight than the Anolon pot, so I am hoping that the Concord stock pot I just ordered will do better than any of these. I asked a question before buying it around this issue of pitting and one person wrote back immediately that she never has that problem with that pot. I hope I won't either!\n",

      "I just bought this heater after seeing a co-worker's unit.  My office area, in the corner of a very large room, is extremely cold all year round.  I have been getting by with a small DeLonghi Safeheat, but wanted something taller to provide heat to my upper body.  I also suffer from hot flashes so I needed something that oscillated.I didn't read any reviews here first.  Just went by my co-worker's glowing praise for hers.  She does sit in an office and I don't.  However, the features seemed to fit my bill.I am quite happy with the heater.  I appreciate the different heat and fan settings.  The oscillation works as I'd hoped - not concentrating the heat right on me.  It keeps me warmer and cuts the draft from the windows.  It is very nice to have a remote so I'm not jumping up and down to change the settings.  I bought it knowing that it would never really heat my area up to the temperatures given.  I just need my area warm enough to work in without a coat.There are only two drawbacks for me so far: the heater vents are about 5 or 6 inches up off the floor so the heat doesn't keep my feet warm.  I have to use the small one for my feet.  The second problem is the beep!  I can understand fully how this would be a problem in a bedroom.  It would wake me up!The light doesn't bother me since I only use it during the day.  I understand people's problem with them in the bedroom, though.  Between my Powerbook and the TV boxes, I swear my bedroom has more small lights than some Xmas trees!  I wish more engineers were aware of the studies on blinking lights and the concept of atavistic threat movement.  [g]For me, the heater only misses a score of 5 due to the annoying beep sound.\n",

      "My first use of this steamvac on my light-gray berber carpet was on the red clay stains just inside the door, and old yellowed cat barf spots that were impervious to all the carpet cleaners and home remedies I had tried previously.  The steamvac cleaned it all up beautifully!Since the nozzle on this unit is only four inches wide, it took a while to do the whole area by the door (maybe 30 minutes for 20 square feet), but the smaller spots took no time.  Once I got used to the motion of cleaning it went more quickly.  You do two 'wet' passes while holding the trigger, which squirts out the hot water and cleaning solution in a fan pattern; then a few 'dry' passes (sans trigger) to suction up the water...you can see through the clear nozzle when there is no more water being taken up. The suction is quite powerful and leaves the carpet just a tad damp... my carpet dried in about an hour.The steamvac is light and easy to carry around, even when full of water.  It has an easy-access fill port on top for putting in the cleaning solution and hot water (which I heated in a glass pitcher in my microwave).  There is an auto shutoff feature when the separate recovery tank (which holds the used water) gets full, and a spout on the side through which you empty out the dirty water.  When I dumped out the recovery tank I was astonished at how much dirt had been in my carpet, even though I'd vacuumed thoroughly before using the steamvac!This little unit does make big noise, but I think that's due to the powerful suction.  I don't consider the noise level a drawback. It's a lot less expensive and a lot more convenient than renting the Rug Doctor or calling in the professional rug cleaners for a few dirty spots.I am SO glad I bought this!\n",

      "I purchased this set of measuring cups after I accidentally threw away a 1/2 C measure from a separate stainless steel set.  Plus, a very good friend of mine recommended them.So far, I'm happy with them.Pros:  The cups nest well whether they're attached to the ring or not.  They also sit completely flat.  The measurement markings are bright and clear, and after owning them for about a month -- I have not seen anything that would suggest that they were fading or will fade as other customers have suggested.  Even if that were to happen, the measurement markings are slightly raised and stamped ONTO the handles, and would be readable without the colored paint.  The 3/4 C measure is great, and eliminates a lot of unnecessary measuring compared to a 1/4 C measure.  The inside of each cup also features a halfway line, which is convenient when you're measuring liquids and only need half the amount the cup measures.Cons:  My only complaint has to do with the storage ring, which is rather large and takes up a lot of drawer space.  When attached to the ring, the cups are also harder to use, so if you purchase these, you'd be better off storing them individually and throwing the ring into your junk drawer.If you need a better look at these cups before deciding whether or not to purchase them, visit Oxo's official website [...]\n",

The motor is very strong, the blade very sharp. I made a fresh tomato coulis out of tomato, dried tomato, oil and herbs in seconds and it had the right texture (chopped but not liquified.)One thing I hate about large food processors is scraping small amounts of chopped herbs or nuts out of the large bowl. If your typical job, like mine, is chopping small items in smaller quantities, this is perfect. It takes up a lot less space on the counter, too.The unit comes in steel color and white.

The thickness of the metal make these shell pans very stiff, and they should endure many years of use. I'm unsure how long the non-stick coating will last but other reviewers have not expressed concerns after purchasing these 5+ years ago.While it has nothing to do with the pan itself, I was disappointed to find out that whole wheat and multi grain tortillas (La Tortilla Factory brand) did not bake well, and virtually inedible (turned rubbery). I tried several attempts precisely following the mfg. directions as well as trying other techniques found posted on the Internet . . . none made them crispy. I re-read most of the 43 reviews hoping to gain insight from others but nothing seemed on point. I then decided to buy some regular flour tortillas. They came out fine following the mfg. directions.I lightly sprayed oil on one pan and not the other, and neither tortilla stuck to the pan, and no noticeable taste difference. So the oil seems unnecessary.A 10-inch tortilla fully fits inside the pan. While I haven't tried one, I think a 14-inch tortilla should work fine even though it would probably extend about 2 inches above the top of pan.We're happy with these pans, and enjoy making tasty taco salads.\n",

While it's not a deep-cleaning vac it does what I bought it to do.....bare tile and hardwood floors.  The sand and grit hauled in by me and my dogs not only grinds on my nerves, it dulls floors.  The Eureka was easy to assemble, hang and use.  I can't comment on its durability yet. One very pleasant surprise is that it is small enough to fit under my bed foundation to get pet hair from a Sheltie (yuk) which I had much trouble reaching with the attachments on my Hoover. The extra battery pack was the final factor that caused me to purchase this.  For bare floors and very smooth rugs/carpets it performs very well.  At its price with battery packs, I'd recommend it highly  ADDITION Aug 2013: While I still like the Eureka and it does everything that a simple, cheap electric broom should do I've discovered one Achilles Heel for it.  The beater brush, used for rugs, winds up lots of rug fabric and thread around the yellow brushes.  There isn't a way to open the beater bar and clean it.  I phoned Eureka and was told that if you remove the four small screws in the head you can clean it BUT(!) you may not be able to reassemble it!  This was their confession.  Other than that annoying feature I am very satisfied with the Eureka Quick Up so far.UPDATE Mar, 2014:  This continues to be a very useful, economical product for my hardwood floors and short fiber carpet.  One hint for using on carpet---use two hands and instead of casually flipping the sweeper about like a mop....apply a little downward pressure with your non-dominant hand and bring the unit back SLOWLY to you.  This is especially helpful when doing a casual clean up of dog hair on the bedroom medium nap carpet.

      "This knife, and theJ.A. Henckels Twin Four Star 3-Inch High Carbon Stainless-Steel Paring Knifeare the two best knives in the Henckels four star collection.  There is something \"just so\" about them.  They are just right, with all the various design parameters coming together to create a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts.  This serrated utility knife works well in a great variety of applications.  The five inch serrated blade is nicely thin (but still thick enough for good strength and rigidity) and shallow (i.e. not broad).  I find it very useful for cutting pie or cake or brownies, as well as (of course) bread and tomatoes and many other vegetables.I've had this knife now for SIXTEEN YEARS, and it is still going strong, and still one of my favorites.  However . . . you must SHARPEN this knife eventually.  Like any other knife, it will go dull.  NEVER HONE THIS KNIFE OR ANY OTHER SERRATED KNIFE!  A sharpening steel is too large a diameter to be used on a serrated knife.  It will only round out the serrations and will not sharpen the knife.  This is NOT the fault of the knife.  It's inherent in the design.  In order to sharpen this knife, you need theSpyderco Sharpmaker Knife Sharpener 204MF.  This setup has triangular ceramic sticks, so you can use the edges (and ONLY the edges) of the rods to sharpen serrated knives. It works great.  Just make sure to read the directions or watch the video to ensure your technique is correct first.  But then a half an hour or so every year will be enough to keep this knife in good working order.  If you've already honed the heck out of a serrated knife, though, start over with a new one.  The Spyderco Sharpmaker won't perform miracles and add steel back onto the points of the serrations or anything!More generally, you need to realize that GOOD KNIVES NEED SHARPENING. Period. And a honing steel IS NOT \"sharpening\". That is honing, or touching up. Not the same. That will only make a good sharpening last a bit longer (although you're much better off with a ceramic hone or the Spyderco Sharpmaker for such touching up, by the way.)  To really resharpen a knife, you need a real sharpening system, or a stone and a lot of practice. I use the Edge Pro Apex for sharpening, and the Sypderco for touching up, and for sharpening serrated knives.If you never want to sharpen a knife, you don't want a knife. You want a SAW. Like the Ginsu knives that used to be on TV. These have small and deep and aggressive serrations that will last almost indefinitely, but the cutting action is very poor.

These cups are stainless steel and somewhat heavy, so they are definitely heavier duty and will stand up over time during your kitchen adventures. They are shaped slightly differently than the standard perfect circle cup and have a slight \"lip,\" which makes it easier to pour into a bowl and makes sure your ingredients go where you want them.Like most measuring cups they come connected to a little ring so you don't lose the one you need when they hit the cupboard. Normally that ring gets torn off quickly during normal use, but here it's a little heavier duty and the cups have a perfect little notch to match the ring, so hopefully they'll stay together longer than with my last measuring cups. That being said, it is still a plastic ring, so I'm expecting it to break at some point down the road.

      "This is a common device in Europe--boiled eggs are a staple in Germany and the egg cooker delivers a reliable result without the trouble of standing over a boiling pot, calculating when the water boiled, how many eggs are in the pot, looking at a sandglass and using a sextant and barometer (ok, I exaggerate. You don't really need the sextant and barometer to make a proper soft-boiled egg.)The Salton cooker has a nice egg rack that lifts out when the eggs are done. You can take the boiled eggs to the sink to cool them in water (halts the cooking, keeps you from burning your fingers.) The settings, however, are different than European. Soft is medium-soft (white done, yolk liquid) medium is a medium hard yolk, and hard is the harboildegg for picnics and salads. (Some European models have a soft setting that is a very liquid egg such as you'd use in Caesar salad dressing. This model does not have that setting.) This cooker will handle up to six eggs and comes with a water measure that has a piercing spike on the bottom in an egg-shaped depression. The egg fits in there for piercing the shell lightly, which is supposed to keep the shell from cracking uncontrollably during cooking.Warning: the top gets VERY hot during use, so lift it off by the small end over the handle ONLY. There is an alarm to alert you when it's done, and an on-off-warm switch. All in all, a great device--well designed, compact and useful.\n",

However, after not working for 2 days, my machine is making perfect bread once again. I have no complaints at all about the machine.  I do advise everyone to accept the fact that they will need to \"babysit\" the machine during the first 10 or 15 minutes of kneading, to make sure that the dough is the right consistency. They may need to use a rubber spatula to scrape flour out of the corners of the bread pan and to add flour and/or water to achieve the perfect consistency.  After that, the machine will take care of the rest.My recommendations for books:  The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook by Beth Hensperger, Rustic European Breads for Your Bread Machine by Eckhardt and Butts,  and Pizza, Focaccia, Flat, and Filled Breads from  your Bread Machine by Lora Brody.I'd also recommend using King Arthur flours (especially the White Whole Wheat flour).Buy a Breadman Ultimate and have fun!\n",

This one fits the bill if you don't have a lot of all-day coffee drinkers in the house. I usually make a full pot in the a.m., unplug it and reheat again in the p.m.  The only problem with percolators is, if you plan to make a second pot, the coffee basket is scalding hot and has to cool down first.

They connect to a caribiner-style hook, and can hang in your kitchen.  They give a good grip when you are trying to measure a 1/4 or 1/3 dram of Drambuie, a 1/2 or 1 cup glog of Grog.  They are tools.We will keep Mario's, and move Biff's measuring tools to the camping supplies.  Good tools.Also,about the bendy handle complaint.  I cannot judge this.  I am a man of immense strength.  I bend almost everything.  Therefore, I hold utensils carefully, like little food-cooking-eggs.  I once bent an elephant.  Also a collander.

I had no problem using them in either round or square containers.If I could make an improvement it would be to make the handles a little longer, so if you need to go deeper into a container it would be easier to get the measuring cup back out.  The handles on these measuring cups, like all Oxo products are very comfortable in your hand, which I love since I do have some dexterity issues.The other thing I might improve on these measuring cups is that yes, you can clearly see what each measuring cup can hold, but I think I would have made the numbers a tad more raised.  I do hope that over time that the measurements are still clearly visible.There are no measurements inside each cup tho.\n",

      "As another reviewer mentioned, there are 2 models that appear identical but with different amps. Mine is the 12 amp 3670 & it is a little powerhouse. After using it for several years, I've finally decided to write up a review. What I wanted was a powerful little canister vac and indeed, this little unit is just that. I see why folks use it as a mini-shop vac. However, here's where I have found it to be problematic for petite me: the long cord. Initially a good idea but in actuality the length is a nuisance. I finally wrapped up what I don't use & tied it up with a velcro strap -- I'd rather unplug a cord a couple of times instead of picking up the durn cord, sidestepping the durn cord & tripping over the ding dang durn cord. The hose: it's unwieldy & is ALIVE! What I mean is, I try to coil the hose & tuck it away &... it just pops out...after me. The hose also kinks easily & I find myself constantly wrestling with it. While the exercise is good, I wish it were more flexible so I could easily coil it around the machine for storage. I use a box to stuff the durn thing in it, to contain it in the closet..& yet it still sets itself free. The brush attachment is useless at best. I use brushes from my former vacs that croaked after years of use. Would I buy this vac again? Probably not. These days, it's regulated to the upstairs bathrooms & dryer vents. I use an upright vac for the carpets. Downstairs there are no carpets & I use \"the critter\". \"The critter\" was a gift to me, is 6 months old & I'm quite fond of it. It's a Eureka Rally 2 at 11amps. It has a retractable cord: YAY! It's not too long: YAY! The hose is quite flexible & stays put when I wind it around \"the critter\": YAY again! I've nicknamed it \"the critter\" because it easily follows me around like my 2 cattledogs. It's lightweight, doesn't trip me up, the METAL wand attachment has this nifty latch that extends it from short to long. It has a small bag & yes, I'll have to change it frequently what with 2 cattledogs, but for me it's the perfect little vac. Note: it is shy on attachments which isn't an issue for me since I've saved my old attachments. For now, I'll keep the Boss 3670 only because it is a workhorse. But, I am using it less & less with \"the critter\" around.\n",

The size of each measure is imprinted in the handle material in a contrasting color (sort of orange), and should last reasonably well.There are no fill lines or other markings or designations, but for measuring non-liquid items, they would be easy to scrape across the top to get a level measure, unlike glass measuring cups.I don't do a lot of baking these days, but I would think these would be outstanding for measuring dry ingredients.They are easy to hold and very sturdy.

      "Oxo Good Grips Flour SifterThe OXO Good Grips Sifter was designed to make sifting easier and faster, and baking that much more enjoyable. The Sifter has no troublesome awkward levers to pull or cold steel handles to squeeze instead, it features a comfortable handle that fits perfectly in your hand. With a slight shake side to side, the sifting mechanism is activated and with little effort you have perfectly sifted flour.  These were the main features that I was looking for in a flour sifter.  Something that you just shook and the flour would be sifted, after-all I'm not looking at the performance of a sports car, this is just a flour sifter. Something that doesn't take up much room, but is efficient in its use with little effort. The top and bottom lids keep flour fresh and the inside of your cupboards clean. The OXO Good Grips Sifter is so much easier to use that you will look forward to those recipes that call for sifted ingredients. Simply shake side to side for sifted flour or powdered sugar Comfortable, ergonomic handle Top and bottom lids keep sifter and cupboards clean, Dishwasher safe.Some of the products features are:* Wide, comfortable, ergonomic handle* Sifter shakes side to side with one-handed operation* Cup and gram measurements listed* Lids seal the top and bottom* Stainless-steel construction* Dimensions: 4.5 IN x 4.63 IN x 6.5 IN* Weight: 8 oz.The covers are used when measuring and sifting, not primarily for storage, the top is not air-tight. Why would you ever store a sifter with any flour in it anyway, you are just asking for problems. Just tap it out completely into the trash or sink to remove excess flour.The top cover is specifically designed to stay on during sifting, keeping flour/cocoa etc. from wafting out while you shake-shake-shake. The bottom cap keeps contents from falling through the mesh screen while you measure flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, etc. into the top. That way, you can move it around your workspace if you need to. If you forgot that pinch of nutmeg that's supposed to be sifted-in with the baking powder and flour, just walk the sifter over to the pantry and shake-in the spice or whatever is needed at the time.  The mess is almost eliminated and you'll enjoy a better baking experience.Think of this sifter as a baker's tool and less as a sifter. This product is great at working with dusting's. If you ever just wanted to do a light powdered sugar coating on something this may be the tool for your because the sift is slow. The second good use is for putting flour down on the counter top to kneed bread. It sifts over a large area so it is quick at making a light dust over a large area. But don't forget that this sifter has a capacity for larger amounts of flour as well. So, you get flexibility, versatility, and convenience, not bad for a flour sifter.I still am sold on the shake and sift mechanism, for the above reasons, and it can be done one handed and you can control the amount of flour sifted easier and it doesn't need to be an all at once speed sift.  I get better results when I take my time baking, after-all, I'm baking and I'm not running the 100 yard dash.  That's what I tell my grandkids when they are over and we make/bake something they enjoy to eat. After a few years of use this sifter is still doing it's intended job and many baked goods later the grandkids still enjoy coming over and learning some new baking skills.\n",

      "The OXO measuring cups arrived and I couldn't wait to try them! They are wonderful! My last set was a little inexpensive set that matched all the kitchen utensils. I was happy enough until the measurement stamps on them started to wear off. I don't keep my cups in a set, but separated in case I need to other things with them or leave them in, say, coffee. These are on a ring, but with the handle design it lets you pull them off easily and also put them back on the ring with no fuss.These are thick stainless steel and can be used to warm small amounts of things like butter, or dissolve Monk fruit granules in vinegar for sushi on the stove. I like the super grip handles. The toughest thing my set will ever have to scoop will be rice. The handles didn't bend at all. I can see where they could, but I don't see the point in torturing a good set of measuring cups. (They aren't really scoops, after all. That's a different design altogether.)I love them! If they sit on the counter, they don't fall over until they are filled. They stay put. I am placing these on my list of top things to have in a kitchen.

      "I have owned two of these trays for about a year and I'm about to buy two more--but why would I do that for a 3-star product? Simply put, they aren't perfect but they're the best of what's out there.What sets these trays apart from others is the lid, which I've learned to both love and hate. I love the lid for one reason: in a frost-free freezer, it prevents ice cubes from evaporating over time. If you use your ice often, that isn't a problem, so I'd say the benefit of the lid to you is not worth the hassle. (More about that in a moment.) But if you're like me, and use ice infrequently, you'll no longer have the experience of reaching for a tray (usually when guests ask for ice) only to find that your cubes have mostly evaporated. Now I always have ice when I need it, even a couple of months after I've filled the tray. I'd say the lids also make for easier stacking.And that, for me, makes it worth putting up with the negatives of this product mentioned in other reviews:1) The lid is a pain to slide on and off--not a big deal after the cubes are frozen, but it can be a real mess-maker when you're filling trays. I now snap the lids on instead of sliding, but I still spill some water no matter how careful I am.2) The cubes are on the smal/medium size, though some may find that to be a benefit.Oxo has been taken to task for poor design on this tray, but I'm not sure that's the case. There just may not be a \"better\" way to put a lid on an ice tray that will protect again evaporation and freezer burn. If you don't see that protection as a benefit to you, then I'd strongly suggest buying a conventional tray. But if you do, then be prepared for the compromises that I and others have mentioned.Thanks for reading my review--I hope it has given you information that will help in your purchase decision!\n",

      "One never really expects much from high tech products that are meant to substitute for elbow grease and common sense, but this gadget is nothing less than fantastic. I am a first-time bread machine owner and was actually astonished that the Breadman does everything that was promised with minimal tweaking. I have discovered, however, that one should be observant during the first kneading operation to make sure that all the dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed into the dough mass. If not, simply add a little water (up to a tablespoon at first), and help the unabsorbed flour etc. into place with GENTLE nudges from a plastic spatula. The machine then does the rest and does it magmificiently. You are now free to go watch television, clean the house, play with computer, nag the spouse, or nap. Because of the necessity for this initial watchfulness, I am very hesitant to try the delayed baking option; also, since many recipes require the inclusion of eggs and other perishable foodstuffs I simply do not think it wise to let the non-cooked ingredients to sit at room temperature for several hours. On the brighter side, I did not find the machine noisy or loud, certainly not as intrusive as the average dishwasher. It's great and I cannot sing its praises too loudly!And, oh yes, the bread is scrumptious!\n",

      "I have had a J.A. Henckels 3\" Fine Edge paring knife for 6 months.  It was a great knife until a family member decided to stick it in a meat grinder last night.  But we won't hold that against the knife.The handle is comfortable and easy to grip.  With 3 through-rivets it is securely attached.  The handle includes a very good front quillon to keep fingers from sliding onto the blade.  The full length tang aligns perfectly with the handle reflecting quality workmanship even though the knife was made in China.The knife was super sharp when first bought, more like a razor blade than a knife blade.  Even though the blade is stainless steel, it kept the fine edge and never needing to be sharpened nor honed.  To help keep it sharp I never put it in the dishwasher to avoid exposure to the harsh detergent.For many purposes the 3\" length will be perfect.  I think that I prefer a slightly longer blade.  There were many times while slicing vegetables that I cut a thin layer of skin off the tip of a finger holding the item being sliced--not enough to draw blood, but always surprising.  This has never happened to me with any other knife and I attribute these little mishaps to the blade being so short that I did not have as good a visual line on the blade as with a longer blade, and because it is so sharp.Henckels makes many fine knives.  The Fine Edge line of knives is a discount line, and prices are quite modest.  I bought an 8\" Fine Edge chef's knife at the same time and have been very happy with it also.  The main difference between these discounted Fine Edge knives and some of the more expensive Henckels lines, other than price, seems to be cosmetic.  Thanks to the encounter with the meat grinder I now am shopping for a new paring knife.  I would have bought another one of these except it is not available with free super saver shipping, and the total cost with shipping seems a bit high.  I think I will buy a 4\" paring knife in stead, but if you are looking for a 3\" knife and like the price, I think you will like this knife.\n",

As an example, even beating some eggs in a bowl to make scrambled eggs - this whisk doesn't have enough stiffness to mix up eggs well.Sorry OXO, but that drops you to a &#34;it's okay&#34; rating of 3 stars.\n",

      "I'm a big fan of OXO kitchen utensils and tools.  I have many OXO kitchen utensils in my kitchen that are nearly 13 years old and are still looking new after years of frequent use.  I was excited when I got the opportunity to review these stainless steel Good Grips measuring cups.  They're great quality and I'm sure they're bound to last through years of repeated use.The handles on these measuring cups are rubberized giving you a nice comfortable grip.  I did notice with my set that the handles do seem to attract dust and small particles of baking ingredients.  I'm not thrilled about that, but it's better than having stainless steel handles that aren't as comfortable to hold.This set only has four measuring cups.  You'll get cups in the following measurements with this set: 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup.  If this set had 1/8 and 3/4 cups I would have given this product five stars.  Many of the recipes I use call for ingredients of either 3/4 or 1/8 of a cup.  I'd much prefer to have to clean one cup to measure out 3/4 vs. using two or having to scoop out the ingredients three times.  It's a pain to have to pack brown sugar into a 1/4 cup three times when a 3/4 cup could have taken care of the job in one shot.  Because the set is missing those two cups that I use on a regular basis, my cheap plastic measuring cups that are 13 years old won't be going anywhere.I do like that you don't have to take all of the measuring cups off the ring to get to the size that you need to use.  My plastic measuring cups are like that and I find it to be a pain in the rear to have to pull half of the cups off to get the one that I need.  The OXO cups eliminate that problem.  You simply pop the cup off the ring and you're good to go.Overall, I think these measuring cups are decent.  For the price I wish they had 3/4 and 1/8 cups, too.  It is a decent quality product that will see you through years of use.\n",

      "I didn't grow up in a family with a pressure cooker (PC), so really the only thing I knew or thought I knew was that they were dangerous, hard to use, something from the past. Boy could I not have been more wrong. I started thinking of getting one probably for the same reasons you are, the appeal of fast cooking, with tasty and healthy results, and improved safety over the pressure cookers from the past. My wife and I have had this model now for a couple of weeks and it delivers on all counts.The basic idea is that because of the pressure that builds up inside, water gets to 250 degrees, it is super hot. And at that temperature it can break down the tough parts of meats and cook things very quickly. Yet it also retains nutrients and tastes good. Well it does cook fast and it is tasty. I will take the experts opinion that it is also a healthy way to cook.As a PC newbee I had no idea what to expect. First off is a little bit of assembly. That went quickly and smoothly. Second is READING the instruction booklet. This is not a pan or a microwave or something like that. It is safe..but also something that is, well, under pressure. And pressure can be dangerous. After getting familiar with the parts of the pressure cooker we cooked our first meal, a pot roast. It was super easy and delicious. We used, frankly, a pretty cheap piece of meat but it came out tasting fantastic. It was quick but something to keep in mind is cooking time does not usually include the time to heat it up and the time to cool it down. Also you can't just walk away. Once the pressure seals the cooker most of the time you have to then reduce the heat. But it really isn't that much oversight.In any event even taking all of that into account it was still by far the fastest pot roast I have ever cooked and better than average in taste. We have done some chicken dishes and some rice dishes. It has turned out perfect rice in a fraction of the time it would have taken otherwise. We are still getting a feel for seasoning. Sometimes we have had dishes too seasoned and other times not but nothing that hasn't been easily as tasty as other ways we cook things.So if you are a PC newbee like me I say give it a try. As long as you read the instructions and respect the pressure it is a pretty easy way to cook with excellent tasty results in a quick amount of time. Granted it has only been a couple of weeks but we have eaten out much less these 2 weeks. We picked up a well regarded cookbook on AmazonPressure Perfect: Two Hour Taste in Twenty Minutes Using Your Pressure Cookerand so far so good. This could easily become the main way you cook, it has that a good a combination of benefits and realtive ease of use. What it excels at is...great results/unit of effort and time. I can't see many other ways that you can maximize your cooking effort and cooking time than a PC.\n",

      "I only recently learned how to shuck oysters and is something I had never done before.I both read about shucking and also had the guy who sold me some oysters explain how to do it.With a little bit of practice, I got it down, and now can open any oyster in no time at all!What you want to do is the following:-Find the point of the oyster that looks like a V-Keep the oyster with the 'cup' (the non flat side) down so that when you open it, the juice from the oyster won't fall out-Initially, you may want to hold the oyster down with a kitchen towel so that it doesn't slip (I initially did this, though after some practice, just hold the oyster with a gloved hand)-Insert the tip of the blade (with the very tip facing upwards) into the V and wiggle it with some force from side to side (but keeping it flat).- After the blade has been inserted 1/4 - 1/3 of an inch, try to pry it open by turning the blade. If you feel some resistance, push through and the oyster will open, but if it doesn't give, don't push through or you will crack the shell, making it opening it so much harder (I find this is the thing that takes the most practice - knowing when to continue to turn the knife to pry the thing open without cracking the shell... so you'll get this with some practice)- After it has opened, insert the blade in all the way with the tip of the knife along the inside of the top half of the shell and cut all around to cut the muscle that is holding it closed- After you remove the top shell, carefully cut the muscle that is holding the bottom shell to the oyster. Also go all around the oyster with the knife as the bottom tends to stick to the shell, and make sure it is free floating- You're done! Add some lemon and tabasco, and voila! Enjoy!I have to say, I have no experience with other knives, but this knife has worked wonders, it has a comfortable grip, the steel is sturdy enough to get past some strong oysters I have encountered, and the slightly upwards bend of the tip makes it easy to cut away at the muscle on the top of the oyster. All in all, perfect! Highly recommended.\n",

      "This blender arrived on Friday the 11th, and is being returned on Monday, the 14th.My first suspicion came as I unpacked the blender and I noticed the base was not chrome, but in fact, plastic.  (which was not disclosed on the technical information).  The cord was thin, and only had two prongs at the end, in comparison with my old Waring blender with a very thick black cord and  3 prongs at the end for heavy duty performance.My enthusiam dampened, I put an inch of freshly peeled and thinly sliced ginger in the blender, went first topuree, then to liquify, then with no decent results went through all of the  different selections and barely got useable results.  I then put in a half of bunch of parsely, (unchopped)  read the instruction booklet, tried the selections for different speeds, and end up with chopped parsley flakes everywhere.  Unwilling to give up in spite of failed attempts, I added my berries, and applesauce. Berries, sweet, soft berries, and soft applesauce. I pureed, I liquidfied, I went through all the speeds, and ended up with bits of berries, ginger, and tons of parsely flakes everywhere and produced the worst unblended drink in my blending career.  Perhaps most people don't blend fresh ginger and parsely (so-o good for you and tasty too), but my old waring blender has been making this drink for me for years, giving me smooth pureed results each time.Hindsight being better than foresight, I realized I allowed myself to be seduced with the very nice new shape of the blender jar, thinking it would work much better than the old shape, and the new \"touch pads\" .  Wrong on both counts.  The wide shortened new shape looks great, but somehow doesn't work as well as the narrow original shape of the blending jars.  The touch pads are a pain to use, and you have to be in the right light to see if you've turned the machine on or if it's off.  I was very disappointed in the blender, but more in Cusinart, a brand I have trusted for years who makes the best food processor imaginable.  So much for trusted brands. I'm refurbishing my Waring blender with new parts, at least I know it works well.\n",

      "I picked this up at the start of summer. i've made quite a few batches of ice cream. My favorites come from the Ben & Jerry cook book. There are a lot of benefits from making your own ice cream. it's cheaper. It's rewarding. It's healthier too. Even if you make the most decadent ice creams, you're still using all natural ingredients with no preservatives.There are some tricks to this machine that greatly help performance.#1 Make sure the bowl is frozen. Leave it overnight. Shake it and if anything sloshes, it's not ready.#2 Chill all ingredients. Even if the ingredients just came from the fridge, put the batter back in. I test my batter to make sure it's 35-38 degrees before starting. This will make the freezing process more gradual, which means the ice crystals will be smaller. Small crystals mean a smoother texture.#3 I let the machine work until there's little or no movement in the ice cream. This depends on how much you've got in the machine, but my recipes make the ice cream expand up above the lip of the container. When ice cream forms over the paddle and doesn't get folded back in, that's when I turn it off.#4 Let it firm up in the freezer for 4-6 hours. IT WILL BE SOFT, maybe even runny, out of the machine. I try to avoid runny, so next time either let the machine run longer or your kitchen may be too warm. Why is runny bad?  Runny is liquid and you want to try and keep air in the ice cream, so the firmer it is going in, the better. Get it in the freezer fast. Also resist the urge to pack the ice cream down, with either a utensil or by dropping it on the counter. A smooth surface may look nice, but you want to keep air in the ice cream. The air is what makes it easy to scoop and gives it a good texture.#5 Put the bowl in a plastic bag while in freezer. This keep the frost out and improves taste. Make sure it's completely dry before going back in the freezer.#6 I'd also recommend going all out and using rich cream batters. These have the least water and will have the best texture. I'd prefer one scoop of really good ice cream to 4 of a crappy sorbet.#7 Add solid stuff near the end. Wait until the last 1/2 of freezing to add your berries, chips, etc. This will help to evenly distribute stuff throughout the mixture. I like to make strawberry, so I mash my berries, drizzle in the juice, then put the mush in during the last 1/2 of the cycle.#8 Store ice cream in an air tight container with plastic wrap pushed down to the surface. I use 1.5 quart Rubbermade  containers. They fit perfectly and allow the least amount of freezer air to touch the ice cream. Fat easily obsorbs oders and can make your ice cream taste funky. You could just keep it in the bowl, but I wouldn't do that unless you plan to eat it all later that day. Plus, the sooner you get the bowl clean and back in the freezer, the sooner you can make more ice cream!I've used a GE model that had two speeds. The slower speed seemed to freeze better. I also know of some machines that have a reverse function. I would be interested in checking these out if this one ever dies.Mine came with an extra bowl, which is nice to have one always frozen.In all, a great purchase and a pretty good price. Haven't bought ice cream from the store since.\n",

      "When I first heard about a zester, I was intrigued. I promptly went out and bought one to remove lemon peel for Lemon Meringue Pie. I decided that a zester had to be the best thing since the invention of the whisk.A \"zester\" allows you to create fine strips of peel from lemons, oranges and other citrus fruits. It is essential for all cooks if you want to remove lemon peel for a Lemon Meringue Pie or for orange peel if you are making Orange Butter.To remove zest from citrus, simply pull the sharp edge of the zester across the fruit peel. The zester has fine holes which are sharp and cut into the peel. This results in fine strips of citrus peel which may then be chopped. If you want to obtain small pieces without having to chop the zest, just pull the sharp edge across a small section at a time. I recommend using organic citrus fruits.If you want to make a pretty display of oranges and lemons, you can use the \"channel knife\" to cut thin strips of peel out of the citrus fruits. The result is a decorative pattern. I start at the top of the citrus fruit and wind my way around to the base. Think of how you peel an apple and it is just as easy.Just a hint: Try to only obtain the yellow layer in lemons, the orange layer in oranges, etc. The white pith is very bitter.~The Rebecca ReviewP.S. This zester lasted over 11 years! I'm having to buy a new one since the metal finally snapped off the handle.\n",

The 1/8 teaspoon is more useful since baking recipes I make do use that measure for salt and leaveners.

      "This is a pretty decent electric popper that heats up fairly quickly and is reasonably easy to clean.  The spin arm detaches from the heating tray and lets you clean the base with reasonable convenience while the bucket itself is a sturdy plastic that can hold quite a bit of popcorn.  The butter tray on top however I find is largely useless, if you use it to dispense butter onto your popcorn as its popping more gets left behind than makes it through the holes provided and then if you're not careful later on, that lid can come off and you wind up with a mess in your lap.  With ordinary grocery store, common grade popcorn it does a pretty good job of popping them with around a 90% pop ratio, though a bit of care has to be given to how much oil you use, too much and less kernels wind up popping, not enough and the popped corn tastes a bit dry and styro-foamy, I found the suggested oil measurements a tad bit on the low side but a good base to tweak off of based upon one's personal preferences.What I was disappointed with however was when I used higher quality kernels that have a much better taste profile that this popper doesn't pop them nearly as well.  I imagine it has to do with how much heat the heating surface produces because when I make the gourmet kernels in my stovetop, they all pop except for a tiny few stubborn kernels.  With this popper I'm lucky to get a 50% popping ratio with my gourmet kernels, and as such this wound up seeing progressively less use.  Its good for what its intended for, making cheap popcorn with a minimum of fuss, but for the kind of popcorn I like I found its performance fell short of my wants.\n",

      "It makes me upset when hearing people complain that a pricey Henckels is not as sharp as a $3.5 knife! It doesn't matter how much you paid for a knife, it needs to be sharpened! The difference between a good and a bad knife is the degree of sharpness it can hold and the duration it will last. A good knife should never be serrated so it can be sharped. A knife of $3.5 will never be as sharp due to the material used.My guess is that some people are comparing a over-used, never sharpened Henckels with a newly bought $3.5 knife. The edge of a knife is a singular point and the sharpness is only determined by the way it is sharpened and the steel composition. A cheap knife after sharpening will go dull quickly and settle to a stable sharpness (much less shaper than a higher end knife). That's why you will see knifes have difficulties cutting through tomato and pork skins. A good knife with well maintained edge can last at least for a few weeks and even that is far better than a newly sharpened cheap knife. A few strokes of sharpening will restore its full luster in no time.A over-used Henckels can be just as bad as a cheap knife unless being taken care of. Whoever thinks an expensive Henckels doesn't need sharpening deserves the suffering and frustration of using a $3.5 knife when cutting through onions, tomatoes and chicken skins.\n",

The steel is definitely quality, and fairly thick, and the bottom is also flat for a better grip on one's countertop.  I also purchased the smaller 2-quart bowl as well, and the bottom of that is sheathed in an attractive blue rubber, that also enhances traction on countertops.My only gripe is that now I need to buy the 6 quart as well, for larger jobs such as cake batter or salads.

After reading many reviews, I bought one. My first foray was making my very first batch of homemade fried chicken. I borrowed tips and ingredients from various sources, created a wet mixture and dry flour mixture. After looking at the parts to the deep fryer and figuring out what they were and how the thing operates, I attempted my first batch of chicken. It was UNBELIEVABLE!!! The fryer really is extremely easy to use and, just as nice, very easy to clean when the fried chicken-fest was over. The draining system is brilliant with the oil filter and container with the built-in holder and splash guard on the filter. I didn't know how easy it would be to re-use the oil for the next great frying event!My husband said it was the best fried chicken he had EVER had! I had to agree that it was delicious! What was quite amazing to me was how little oil/grease remained on the paper towel after placing the chicken on it prior to moving to a plate. It really seemed to retain very little grease. Yet the chicken was very crispy and very juicy. I had read that this was a big perk of this machine, and now I clearly see why.Having succeeded on my first attempt, I can't wait to make more stuff in that fryer! Mozzerella sticks, fried mushrooms, fish fillets, the sky's the limit! I couldn't be more pleased with this fryer! It's perfect for the first-time fryer, and I would imagine quite impressive for the veteran fryer!\n",

I continued to search Amazon every so often until they had it. I bought it immediately and have now used it a number of times. As other reviewers have said - the quality is superb, the finish excellent, and the design is quite eyecatching. Cakes release easily with just a misting of spray, clean up is easy. The design is crisp and clean. Glazing it does present a bit of a problem, as the deep pattern forms a trough which funnels glaze right down to the plate. Just glaze it on a cooling rack set in a cookie sheet and you won't have the mess on the plate or counter. Scrape up the glaze from the cookie sheet (might have to heat it briefly to get it to flow again) and continue to glaze until it looks how you want it to look. This pan is not as large as the commercial version, so it might not hold all of a large recipe. Don't fill beyond about 1.5 inches below the top, or you might have a mess in the oven (uh, I know this how?  Yep, I did it.) Any excess batter can be baked in a small loaf pan or small cake pan.BTW, bakers. Please encourage Amazon to bring back the 4 for 3 promotion in baking pans.

      "Overall I like this popper. No real mess and popcorn in less than ten minutes with virtually every kernel popped without having to stand over it and shake the pot like you do on a stove.The only negatives I have are:1) that it doesn't automatically turn off when done as advertised so you have to keep an eye on it if you don't want your popcorn to burn.2) the method of applying butter is not very good. You place chunks of butter into the top of the dome and the heat from the popping melts it, dripping the butter evenly onto the popcorn as it is stirred by the stirring arms. The problem is that some of the holes are indented and some are raised. If you mistakenly place the chunks onto the raised vents, the butter doesn't drop onto the popcorn because it takes too long to melt and flow over to the indeted vents. The vents meant for dripping the butter should be divided from those meant srictly for vening the steam generated by popping the corn. This way you don't accidentally block too many of the vents, which would cause the popcorn to become soggy.These are the reasons I only gave it 3 stars instead of 5. Fix these two problems and it is definately a 5 star product. I still love it a lot more than manually popping over a stove in a pot. The popcorn comes out a whole lot less greasy and 99.9% of the kernels pop unstead of about 90% the old fashinoned way.\n",

It may be called a &quot;jelly roll&quot; pan, but I can bake upwards of a dozen cookies on it and rarely burn one.  With the old nonstick sheets (of which I tried and discarded several brands over the years)the burn rate was more like 25-50%.  Other uses for this sheet are under other open dishes, like casseroles and pies, for catching the drips and runovers -- the raised sides make this possible.Using a sheet of parchment paper or a silicone mat, cleanup is a snap.  Once in a while it doesn't hurt to handwash to remove accumulated residue on the edges, but it takes a lot of baking before that becomes an issue.This pan will occasionally warp at the higher temperatures, but always snaps back as it cools down.  I don't think I've come across a baking sheet yet that hasn't done that at one time or another, so it probably just comes with the territory.It looks like I am done with forever replacing my scratched cookie sheets!\n",

So much water is removed with this nifty gadget, that I'm able to put the cleaned (dry!) lettuce into a crisper, where it keeps for several days without moisture to bring it to an early decay.If it seems like one of those kitchen gadgets you'd marvel over and then place in a cabinet, never to be seen again.. it'd not.  If you do enjoy fresh salads, greens or herbs, I promise you will use this tool frequently.  I've found it very helpful when cooking with herbs, as I'm able to \"spin\" more of the water from them after washing (there is a separate \"herb spinner\", but I found it difficult to justify adding more items to my over-stuffed kitchen).Before buying, I compared models carefully, and even today, this still seems to offer the most \"bang\" for the buck.

The blades were wrong or the motor was a piece of dog poop.This fan is near perfect!  The three speeds are great. The motor noise is NORMAL given the amount of air this thing can move. I use mine mostly outside on the patio because I love the outdoors even on a hot day. This fan keeps me and my company super cool.I often set the fan up on a side table so is is blowing on our upper bodies rather than just our legs.We had a heat wave recently and my air conditioner in my motorhome was struggling inside, so I brought the fan inside from the patio.  It really helped cool the motorhome and keep the air conditioner from freaking out.The price is right, the fan really works, really cools. The noise is normal given the nice gale force wind you can get out of this on the high setting.My only complaint to the manufacturer is that the legs that are supposed to keep it from tipping over are ridiculous. First they need 2 on each side, not just 2 on one side. They are very small and super flimsy. Four legs about an inch or two longer would have been a huge bonus. If the fan is off and you accidentally bump it just the least little bit, BANG, it falls right over on the side that has no anti-tip legs.The fan is very light and easy to store when not in use.

I now understand that I should sharpen my knives once or twice a year but I should hone them every time I use them.  Honing doesn't remove any metal, so it won't wear out the blade.In my testing, 5 passes along each side of the blade (10 total swipes) is enough to make my Pro S Chef's knife cut like it is brand new every time.This particular steel has a very high quality feel and it also is very long so my long chef's knife doesn't run out of runway.I wish I had learned about this a long time ago!\n",

      "I have never spent more than maybe $10 on a fan in my life, so I was kinda antsy about buying this one, but seriously, it was absolutely worth the price for me.Let me explain my situation: My building is really old, retains a LOT of heat, and the wiring is such that tenants are only allowed to have one small window AC unit per apartment. Moving it back and forth from one side to the other is a huge pain, but it results in a sort of less-dramatic Sophie's Choice: do we leave the AC in the bedroom so we can actually sleep, or leave it in the living room/kitchen so that we can actually get things done without dying of heatstroke? So that's why I bought this fan--to help move air in the kitchen/living area and hopefully make both rooms habitable during the heat. I haven't gotten the chance to test it during a major heat wave yet (hopefully I won't NEED to *crosses fingers*) but so far, I could not be more pleased with how well it works.What I love the most about it is the versatility. It is nearly silent on the \"low\" settings, but when you set it on \"high,\" it moves a LOT of air. The fact that you can flip back and forth between intake and exhaust is really one of the selling points--it's super-handy in our combined kitchen/living room because, when my partner is cooking, we can flip it on to draw out a lot of the heat it produces. If we open up all the rooms, it helps a lot with cross-ventilation--way more than the box fan we were using previously. In addition, our old building has huge radiators which produce a TON of heat in the winter, and the exhaust function, when placed in a window near the radiator, helps a lot with keeping it from becoming too hot in here. Bonus! Basically, it does everything I hoped it would do, and a couple of things I didn't even anticipate.I also love the way it's shaped--it fits nicely in the windowframe, and has a cute retro appeal. It's front-heavy, but still quite easy to move. It's also easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning, which is a HUGE plus.My only complaints, all of which are extremely minor:-I wish it were a little flatter, just because now we can't really close the indoor shutters on that window, but that's an unusual situation (most people probably don't have those!) and I won't fault the design for it.-I'm a little concerned about the switch--it seems a bit flimsy and I'm afraid it'll break if I turn it with too much enthusiasm. But, so far, so good!-while it's pretty quiet, it does make a distinctive noise on the exhaust setting. It's a bit annoying, but if you're more than a few feet away, you can't really hear it--I've used it while napping on the couch before and not found it distracting.\n",

I have fried calamari, fish for tacos, mushrooms, and even cheese sticks in it to great results. The pic of the fries I posted above were just cooked last night.It is extremely easy to clean, uses a fairly small amount of oil, and does a good job of filtering out that \"deep frying\" smell that can pervade the kitchen when you are frying. So, why 4 stars? Because it is pretty low capacity. Doing fries for a neighborhood party, I had to do many batches, and keep them warm in the oven. It was a bit of a pain, but I don't often have a reason to have a larger-capacity fryer.\n",

      "I'm used to using measuring implements with a bit of weight. Metal, with more metal, held together by metal. These guys are plastic, and chunky as heck. The shape of the measuring cups is such that the flour tends to not stick to the corners of the bottom. You know how when you measure out things like corn starch on a humid day, and the thing tends to stick to the bottom, because of the shape of the measuring device? Because these have a rounded edge, as well as that ovular shape with tapered stuff going on, the flour seems to slip right out. Definite bonus.I don't think that the numbers will stay the colour that they are for very long, as the increment of the size of cup is printed on raised lettering with a coat of paint over it. Because it's raised, it's going to be exposed to the elements more than it would if it were sunken into the handle. That being said, because it is raised, there is no pocket for flour to collect in. This means that if I need to switch from regular baking to gluten free baking, I need only give the cups a quick rinse, and I'm safe. With other measuring cups, who have things pressed into them, there is the concern that flour will collect into those pockets, and not come out completely.In my hands, they feel a bit chunky. I'm not a huge fan of the feel, but I guess that if you had small hands, or other such issues with gripping things, you'd appreciate the feel.They have the increments that bakers use, like 1/3, 1/4, 1/2, but also 3/4, and 2/3. VERY handy, so that you don't need to repeatedly do 3 separate 1/4 cup measurements if you want 3/4 of a cup of something. Very handy. The loop that they attach to can easily be snapped on or off. Handy feature. I don't like the cups lassoed together while I bake. I prefer to unhook them, do my measuring, wash them off, then put them back on the ring for storage.\n",

I read one review where the person said the numbers wear off, so I have only washed the spoons by hand instead of putting them in the dishwasher.All in all, not a bad set of measuring spoons for the cheap price, but I have another set of measuring spoons that I paid the same price for that I like much better.

I didn't think it was gonna be a very smart purchase as it seemed to be limited in the uses.  well let me be the first to say i was wrong.  Making soups and stews are a no brainer, making a modest batch of soup stock in short notice is such a time saver.  take the bones and a few root veggies add water, let the cooker come to a pressure and leave for 45 minutes and you have some decent soup base.  The same lines as stews, get some cheaper cuts of meats and cube it up, add your standard seasoning and a can of beer let it run for 15 odd minutes turn off the heat and let it come down in pressure by itself and you have one awesome tender meal.  yeah, you could make the same thing in a regular pot but when you get the same results in a short time it's a simple answer.  why slave in the kitchen when you can be almost a one pot meal.  plus these meals are awesome in the fall.\n",

However, its definitely earned its place in our kitchen and made cutting a far more pleasurable process.Pros: Sharpens well, easy to use.Cons: Pretty much butchers carving knives or anything narrower, scratches any knife with multiple contours (carving knife) as its difficult to keep them at a consistent angle, not the ultimate in edge sharpness, need to follow-up with a steel until the burrs are gone.  The last should be done anyway but on the 110 its a must as the last side done will be left with a burr.I started out like many, a set of high-end German knives and wondering why my old Chicago's cut far better.  Back to the manufacturer for a sharpening.  Still inferior to the Chicago's (now thrown away).  Sent back a while later, still a poor edge (though looked nice).  Then I bought the 110, butchered the look of the edge but the knives cut beautifully, for the first time.If you want an easy to use sharpener that results in a consistently decent cutting edge, the 110 is highly recommended.  It will make the task of cutting a lot more pleasurable.  On the other hand, if you are now using stones, you will not like the 110.  Its pretty crude and its not going to give you the fine edge a stone will provide (assuming you are adept at using it).\n",

When I moved out here to Utah my Sons girlfriend threw away the old slicer that I had. I ordered this one when she moved out and I took over the cooking.  This is one of the most versatile and useful slicers I have ever had. The only drawback I can find is that there aren't quite enough inserts to do what it would be otherwise capable of doing. It slices potatoes, onions and everything I've tried to slice and the neat thing about it is you can put it over a big bowl and not be having to empty a small container all the time. They gripper has long prongs that retract as you get closer to the blade and it holds most foods quite securely keeping your fingers away from the slicing blade. Somebody wrote that the holder was a joke, but if you want a joke get the ones that have the little plastic points sticking out that won't hold anything. I gave it four stars because of the insert problem I mentioned earlier. But as far as slicing and dicing you can do it as fast as you can push a vegetable back and forth. As a longtime cook I highly recommend this product for fast slicing and keeping your fingers out-of-the-way. fredt\n",

      "This review is from: Kuhn Rikon Family Style Pressure Cooker 8 Quart (Kitchen)I grew up with food cooked in the old style pressure cooker in China, but never wanted to use it myself because it didn't look safe - steam hissing out of the valve that looked about to fly into the ceiling at any moment. But recently, a friend of mine in China (who owns both Fissler and WMF Ultra) convinced me that the newer pressure cooker is a totally different game. It makes cooking super fast and food comes out delicious. Tempted, I decided to get one also. The short version is that I got Kuhn Ricon Family Style pressure cooker 8qt. Cooking with it is easy and fast, and food indeed come out extremely good! Below is the long version of the comparison between different makers and different sizes.In terms of the maker, the top 3 contenders are: Fissler, WMF and Kuhn Rikon. WMF only sells their entry level model (\"Perfect Plus\") in the US and it is getting mixed reviews. The improved model (\"Perfect Ultra\") is better and more durable but not available in the US. Fissler seems to have similar issues as WMF \"Perfect Plus\": its plastic handle is prone to cracking. So I decided to go with Kuhn Rikon (KR) which is all steel and old style mechanics, but really durable and foolproof with 5 different safety features.Once I decided on the maker, choosing the right size was another challenge. The measurements on KR's website are a bit confusing and incomplete. After talking to the customer service, I got the following dimensions:stockpot 6qt: 8.75\" (&#981;), 7\" (h), 8 lb.stockpot 8qt: 8.75\" (&#981;), 9\" (h), 8.5 lb.family style 8qt: 11\" (&#981;), 6\" (h), 12 lb.Note: Add 2.5\" to the height with the lid on. Actual capacity is 2/3 as you can only fill the pot up to its 2/3.After getting KR Stockpot 8qt initially and then exchanged it with a Family Style 8qt, I come to the following conclusions:* Stockpot 6qt: ideal for small family and small serving sizes, but too small to make 6 servings or large batch of stocks.* Stockpot 8qt: 2\" taller than and same diameter as the 6qt. The shape is not practical -- very tall and narrow -- other than having an extra 2qt capacity for making stock, you can't do much more than what you can with a 6qt pot.* Family Style 8qt: It is much heavier with a thicker rubber ring and a much larger cooking surface. I find it to be the most versatile for making different foods with different methods (steaming whole fish, whole vegi, making stocks, browning large cut of meat, etc.), and great for double-deck cooking (cooking something in the pot and steaming something on the rack). Downside: not ideal for making small serving sizes. A cup of water just covers the bottom. My way to get around it so far is to steam the smaller serving such as a cup of rice in a bowl instead of cooking it in the water.If I could have two pc, I'd get 1 6qt stockpot and 1 8qt family style pot. But if I can only have one pc, I prefer the family style pot for its flexibility.The pressure cooker is very easy to use:* bring the content to boil, the valve on the lid starts to rise, pressure starts to build up in the pc.* To adjust the pressure: the valve has 2 red rings, ring I - lower pressure, ring II - higher pressure. Once the pressure reaches the desired level, turn the heat down to maintain the pressure level (about 2-3 on my induction cook top). When the valve rises to 2.5 rings level, the valve will automatically let the steam out with a hissing sound.* To close the lid: unlike other pc, KR has short handles which are great for storage. Initially, I was concerned about whether it could be opened and closed easily. Once I used it, my worries went away. There is an arrow on the lid. Position the lid so that the arrow points to the handle, twist, it closes.* To de-pressure: 3 modes: 1) fast: less than 30 sec. by rinsing the rim of the lid with cold running water; 2) normal: about 1 min. by pressing the valve with a spoon; 3) slow: about 10 min. by letting it cool down naturally. The above time is based on steaming with very little water in the pc. If you have a lot of liquid food in the pc, it will take a bit longer.A useful accessory for steaming or double-deck cooking: WMF trivetThe rack that is included in the KR pc only stands to 1/4\" tall. WMF trivet is about 2\" tall. With the KR rack on the WMF trivet, food is away from the water and double rack cooking is possible.\n",

Though it lives on the bartop, it see's very frequent use at both bar and kitchen.I've gone through a lot of alternatives, including theKolder Original Mini Measure, Multi-Purpose Measuring Glass(which had 'markings' that couldn't survive more than a few months), and a series of other 'Bar Measure' glasses (likewise couldn't hold on to their measurements). But the Perfect Beaker just keeps steaming along. It's dead-accurate, for the mixology fan.

I didn't believe it really could; I bought it because I was ready to try anything cleaner than oil and stones - even my diamond hone could not refurbish abused blades to my satisfaction.This machine fixes the problems of those ratty sharpeners on the backs of can openers, the messy and oily hones, the ineffective and tiring ceramic 'V' contraptions - and the user errors. The slots align the blade to the correct angle and keep it that way - the user just stabilizes the knife handle and keeps the blade from running through too quickly. It is that easy!The stages run from coarse grit (for horribly dull blades that you used to cut branches in the garden last summer) to extra fine (to finish the edge or re-align the blade edge after use). Even my cleaver is sharp enough to cut joints instead of bludgeoning the entire beast into submission. Best of all, it sharpens quickly; it is no longer a messy, all day chore to get sharp knives.The only down side is that the sharpener is hard to use on short blades or scissors - although it can touch up the tips of straight-edged snippers.Once you get your blades in shape, keep this machine handy so you can maintain those desirably sharp edges.You can do it!\n",

Very useful for dry ingredients especially, but can also be easily utilized for liquids as well.  I like the grippy texture on the handles, and how easy it is to remove the cups from the ring that it comes attached to.  The cups feel substantial and sturdy and seem like they will last in my kitchen for a long time (will have to update on wear after a few more usage).  The slight angle to the cup makes scooping out dry ingredients a mess-free job -- I used the 1 cup this evening to scoop out a cup of quinoa and not a single grain was wasted.  I held the cup over the pan to pour water and the rim of the cup made it easy to get the water filled to the very top without spilling.  I look forward to cooking and baking more with these measuring cups, that are both functional and good looking.Update: After using these measuring cups a few times to cook and bake, I feel they are excellent quality and so glad OXO improved on the old design which the prior year's reviews detailed regarding bending and flexing.

      "I'm on my third or fourth one of these, can't remember. Why so many? Because the wimpy plastic parts tend to break here & there or you mess up the mesh filter or ultimately the carafe breaks. Sure, this can happen with any maker that has to employ clever methods to deliver fresh-ground beans and water into an instant-drip mechanism, but if Melitta wanted to, they could have re-designed its weakest parts by now.It'd also cost upwards of what a Capresso maker does, so rather than opt for something more bulletproof, I've chosen to replace broken Mill & Brews when they couldn't be mended and now use the stainless steel model to avoid the inevitable destruction of the glass carafe.If you use good quality, freshly-roasted beans in this thing and utterly-filtered H20, you can produce an outstanding pot of coffee. Since it has no water filter whatsoever, you're responsible for that part as well as the occasional run-through with a weak vinegar/water solution to keep its insides honest.One reason I got the Mill & Brew was its completely programmable timer. But if you're anywhere near the thing when it wakes up and goes to work, you won't need an alarm clock in the house.So like the 665 folks before me, I'll take the \"devil's number\" here and recommend the Mill & Brew as a very good self-starting, self-grinding coffee maker.

I haven't been able to determine which settings match to the amount of ground coffee that I like to put into the coffee maker and the catcher isn't condusive to scooping the coffee out with a scoop.I guess I don't have enough experience with all the different types of coffee grinders to give this a fair rating, but I don't care for it - it's going back - I gave it one star.\n",

However, with 9 cats and 3 dogs, all of whom shed, I found that not only would that vacuum become very clogged with pet hair and other debris, it was very difficult to clean out all of the residue that remained, after vacuuming.  It's now gotten to the point where the machine needs to be taken apart, and professionally cleaned.  I decided to try another type of cordless vacuum, and chose the Eureka Quick Up Cordless, after doing a fair amount of research.  I will say that, for the most part, it works well.  I like the idea of having an extra battery pack.  The suction with this vacuum is adequate for what I need, and pulling excess pet hair out of the brushes, after vacuuming, is much less problematic than with the Hoover Linx.  The cleaning head has a much more open design, and has easy access for cleaning it out.  In my household, there is absolutely no getting around this last step, after I have vacuumed.  For the time being, I think this little vacuum will serve the purpose for my needs.  There is no question, however, that it will never take the place of the larger, more powerful vacuum cleaners.

It slipped right out and was perfectly browned all the way around. If this pan can make a fluffy cheap mix look as nice as it did, I'm excited to see what it will do with a denser and nicer recipe.

We are extremely happy with this purchase so far.  We've made vegetarian chili (using TVP instead of meat), Pan-in-pot method brown rice, pulled pork (from an 8+ pound shoulder roast) all with great success.  The puled pork was extremely tender and surprisingly delicious.  We also made one of the recipes from the included cookbook (Italian Chicken) and were delighted with the results.Most impressive is how quickly this cooker comes up to pressure and how quickly pressure releases using the natural release method.  One thing we needed to re-learn:  determining when to turn the heat down as the cooker gets to cooking pressure.  The older cooker makes a racket with the jiggler rocking and steam hissing. This one is very quiet and needs to be watched as it comes up to pressure so that it doesn't go beyond its proper cooking pressure.  We really appreciate how quickly this cooker responds to the flame adjustments on the stove.  Overall, we are impressed and sorry we waited so long to make this investment.

      "March 2, 2009: RIPI know this grinder is not in stock and probably discontinued, but cannot resist adding this final note. After eight years of use, my spouse noticed this morning that ground coffee was coming out the ventilation opening on the bottom of the machine. She started shaking the grinder a bit, and more coffee came out. Since it had seemed noisier lately, I decided to take the DeLonghi apart and give it a thorough cleaning.Well...close to a POUND of ground coffee was filling up every empty space in the housing! Tap, brush, and grind produced more and more grounds. It got comical after a while. We had been going through more bean coffee lately, and I should have paid attention to my intuition about that.I reassembled the machine, and sorry to say, almost no coffee was ejected into the grinds cup. It appears that a critical seal failed, and now my DeLonghi is hoarding all the grinds for itself. It may have been so full up that it was producing close to normal levels of grinds -- until I cleaned it.After such a long period of time and over 3,000 pots of coffee, I don't think this grinder owes me anything. Here's hoping I can find a suitable replacement.[[It's worth losing 35 \"helpful\" votes to add a follow-up to my original review: After three years, the only thing that has changed is that the grinds container has cracked. This affects, slightly, how the container fits into the grinder, but does not seem to affect the operation, which is still as described below. I can still recommend this workhorse after over one thousand cycles of use.]]My last coffee grinder was also a burr grinder with an electronic timer -- I got it free as a reject from a tag sale and used it for nearly a year. It ground coffee pretty well but the timer was grossly inaccurate. This DeLonghi seems to have the same general mechanism, but it does a better job with the core task of grinding. The grinder itself is much quieter than my previous machine ... there is hardly any motor sound and the grinding itself sounds almost like a chattering buzz. The manufacturer did a good job of insulating the motor from the housing to reduce noise. The grinds fall into the hopper at room temperature, as they should from a burr grinder. The resulting coffee was darker in tone, and tasted slightly richer for the same amount (by measurement) and approximately the same coarseness as the old machine.I especially liked that the machine comes apart easily -- the top storage hopper screws off and can be washed (the top grinder is attached to the hopper). This also gives easy access to the bottom grinder, which can be brushed clean.The timer is a little hard to set, but seems accurate in comparison with the old machine.This grinder is a bargain. I recommend it whole-heartedly.\n",

It cooks less expensive cuts of beef (stew meat, chuck roast, corned beef) to mouth watering tenderness in a fraction of the time required in either an oven or slow cooker.  It quickly cooks two or three pounds of chicken for salads, sandwiches, or freezing.  Cook a pork roast with your favorite barbeque sauce in 30-45 minutes and enjoy pulled pork sandwiches infused with the flavor of the sauce.  This would be a great tool for the cook who likes make- ahead meals and stocking the freezer for quick-reheating weekday dinners.  Get the stainless steel model to avoid the reaction of aluminum to acidic foods.

However, the interior is degrading. We've been noticing black flakes/dust/debris for a while now. When I pour out boiled water, the black stuff comes out with the last part of the water.

I don't know how healthy this is to drink and we do leave water sitting in the kettle on the stove. It has never boiled dry.

      "Back in the 80's and 90's, I had an Italian Il Gelataio ice cream machine that both churned and froze at the same time--as this Lello 4080 does.  It was a battle to clean it and I always had trouble getting the bowl to release so I could remove it to clean.  It was such a pain to clean, that I stopped making ice cream.  Then I tried a Cuisinart ice cream maker where I had to store the bowl in the freezer.  And the huge, cumbersome paddle and the ice cream frozen to the sides and bottom made it very messy to clean.  So, I was afraid to spend the money on this Lello.  How hard would it be to clean a bowl that is part of the machine and can't be removed?Well, I'm posting this review to say that it is amazingly easy to clean.  Do not fear.  So easy to clean that I'm making more ice cream than ever before.  The quality of the stainless steel is wonderful to work with.  The shallower bowl, coupled with the beautiful steel (without seams), coupled with a removable paddle and ice cream that does not freeze against the wall of the bowl makes it very easy to get the ice cream out and clean up the little left in the bowl.  To clean, all you have to do is pour in 1/4 cup of warm water, then take a dry clean dish rag and sop out the residue and water.  Then rinse your rag and wipe again.  Cleaning doesn't even take four minutes.  (Just don't overload the bowl to begin with.  If you overload the bowl, the ice cream will \"grow\" over the sides--and you will have a mess!)We have found that the ice cream created by this machine is far creamier than in any other machine we've had.  I don't know, maybe it is the freezing temperature, maybe the force and speed of the paddle, maybe the way the steel conducts the correct temperature.  But somehow this machine makes a creamy ice cream that beats all others.The recipes provided are very fine-flavored and a great introduction to the types and sizes of deserts that can be accommodated by this machine.  For years my favorite ice cream cookbook has beenBen & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream & Dessert Bookand those recipes work very well with this machine.  (Ben and Jerry's recipes use raw eggs, which is not a problem for us because we raise chickens for eggs, (but you should be aware of that before purchasing their book).  Because this machine produces such creamy results, I'm in search of a great gelato cookbook.It is big and heavy, so before you purchase it, make sure you find the perfect place for it.  You don't want to be trying to lift it down from a shelf above arm-level.  Its feet are very sturdy and do not scratch (unless there is a sandy particle stuck to the bottom of one of the feet), so the machine is easy to slide back and forth.  It is also good to know that the black, heavy-duty cord is very long.I don't care how much this machine cost.  It is worth it, and our family is very happy to have it.\n",

      "I have been using the Mini-Prep for a few years.  I like to use it for small jobs like chopping herbs, parmesan cheese, and for making pesto.  I haven't had any problems with processing parmesan cheese as one reviewer did.  The blade has two sides, a blunt side for processing hard items like parmesan cheese, chocolate, and coffee beans and a sharp side for processing soft items such as onions, garlic, meats, and mushrooms.  The sharp side is labeled sharp.  If you alternate between processing hard and soft items, you have to remember to check the position of the blade to make sure you are processing with the right side.  In addition, the processor has two speeds, HI & LO.  The LO speed is recommended for use with the sharp side of the blade and pulse action while the HI speed is recommended for use with the blunt side of the blade and continuous processing.  The Mini-Prep has a lot of kick to it for such a small appliance, and I have found it best to hold it steady with one hand, particularly when processing hard food items, because it will jump when powered on.One thing I noticed, in the instruction and recipe manual under Operating Techniques, the instructions indicate that hard cheese is processed with a blade and position speed of Blunt/HI but the instructions for grated parmesan cheese in the recipe section uses Sharp/HI.  I pulse at BLUNT/HI and then do continuous hold until its grated like I want it.  For best results, cut the cheese into small pieces as indicated in the instruction manual before processing.The Mini-Prep does a fairly decent job of chopping onions and garlic. On occasion I find a stray piece that the blades missed but that's probably because I don't always cut the pieces as recommended.  Overall, I think this is a great little processor and well worth the price.  Just remember to read the instruction manual before you start using it.\n",

      "This mid-priced line of Henckel knives, called &quot;Classic&quot; by the company, is a full-tang, single-piece, three-rivet line with sturdy black plastic handles. The handles are notched at the end to prevent the hand from sliding off during use. Although they are not razor sharp right from the package, their edges are sharp enough for the average cook. According to Henckel, all knives in this line are dishwasher safe, but you should expect more rapid dulling under the harsh conditions.The paring knife has much more weight in the handle than in the blade, making its use feel somewhat awkward. This imbalance results from a relatively long handle which makes it easy to hang onto firmly and therefore more safely than some other brands, especially for those with large hands. Although the paring knife blade is also longer than my Chicago Cutlery paring knife, the change in weight isn't fully offset.

A couple other reviews mentioned issues with the button labels peeling off (under warranty, I'd have gotten an immediate replacement - could have missed QC), dripping into the blade housing (no clue how that could happen unless the user held a glass directly over the blade seat) and the motor burning out after \"only\" 2 years (no mention whether the use was extremely heavy, or not). Those really didn't concern me since there were only a few of those. The more predominant reviews were fairly glowing, and those I paid attention to.Mine won't get daily ice crushing duties...only occasional...and I have no plans to try and crush seeds/nuts/cinnamon sticks (that's what my spice grinder and food processor are for), so that doesn't really concern me.

It was not functional anymore. So I purchased this one to replace it. Wow! this guy can open anything! I order canned Blue W. grain-free dog food five cases at a time, and when they're shipped to me, many of them end up dented, even on the top rim. No problem for this heavy-duty opener. The cans I order online have pop-tops, but I like to use the opener because once it has removed the top I can shake out the contents in one piece and then divide it into precise portions. (With a pop-top, you have to dig the contents out with a spoon.) So I am very pleased with this opener.However, I do want to say that when my previous lighter-weight one died, I went to the OXO website and contacted Customer Service via email, and described the problem. They got right back to me and asked me to email them a photo of the broken opener. Even though the flaw was not evident in the photo, they took my word for it that it was not working, and without asking for a receipt for proof of purchase (which was long gone), or even requiring returning the actual opener by mail, they sent me a replacement within 10 days, no charge. The replacement was the other can opener with the magnetic lid catcher, and it works well for almost all cans.But this one is the heavy-duty master.  Thank you, OXO.

      "Sequence of events that led to this review:1. I exchanged the first Oxo kettle I bought because the lid (not the spout) did not fit right, and the steam escaping from the top burned my hand.2. I returned the 2nd kettle because the lid was so tight I had to have my husband open it or fill it through the spout. (This made cleaning it impossible.)3. The 3rd kettle was returned beacuse it had flaws in the finish and would eventually turn into rust spots.I gave up and expressed my disappointment to Oxo about this kettle, They were kind enough to send one to me. This kettle was great -- at first; but, after awhile, the handle loosened up and, yes, steam began to escape.  It now sits atop my refrigerator looking down on my ten-dollar kettle that has lasted me for years.Save your money.  It's a great concept but short-lived.\n",

      "Reviewed many pressure cookers before deciding on this one.  While it requires a bit of assembly (handles and valve) these are minor issues.  Very well made cooker and the 64 page booklet included useful information and recipes.  Bought the 4 quart model since use for one person most of the time.  Not having used pressure cooker before appreciated the warnings and useful tips on how to use safely.  Like the fact that Presto has replacement seals when needed.  Obviously cooker is useless if do not have this seal and in time am sure will require replacement.  Buying one for my daughter as well who is busy career woman and wants to eat healthy and quickly.  Keeping nutrients and vitamins in the food a plus as is the savings in time cooking a good meal.  Easy to recommend this item.The instruction book that comes with this cooker is probably one of the best I have read in recent years.  At the same time it is also very detailed in the care, maintenance and handling of the cooker.  For example, it recommends replacing the seal and the safety plug once every two years.  Of course that probably depends on the amount of use and the care you take of the product.  In any case recommends replacing the safety plug when you replace the seal.  Both are available on Amazon but this will mean a continuing cost to use the product. At the moment using Amazon Prime cost is about $15 for the pair of items or roughly $7.50 a year if replace every two years. I do highly recommend anyone wanting to use the product to read the instructions very carefully and perhaps highlight the key items.  For example what foods to cook and more important what foods not to cook.  What level in the pot to use for various items depending on their expansion during cooking.  Also you need to look through the hole for the safety plug to be sure it is clear and use pipe cleaners to clean that hole and also the hole through the nut, all explained very clearly in the instructions.  Various tips on how to clean (and how not to clean) the pot are very useful.  If you have induction stove you will need the stainless steel pot since the aluminum pots are not magnetic, but then you probably knew that.Today with so many instructions written in China often they are difficult to read or not very worthwhile.  The instructions with this cooker are quite different. They are important to use the product safely and to get the most value out of the product.  If you are someone who seldom reads instructions or is not willing to spend an hour or so learning about this cooking method or who will not take the time to follow the safety instructions then you probably should consider a different method of cooking.  But an hour or so spent learning about he product will pay off in better cooking, shorter time spent cooking and more healthy eating. I ordered a second cooker for my busy career oriented daughter but then cancelled the order after reading the instructions as I am not sure as busy as she is that she would read and follow them.  I plan to show her mine and see if she will spend the time to learn the system.  If so will order again for her.  Or give her mine and buy second for myself. To me it is worth spending the time to learn about safely using this product but I can see that it is not for everyone.  It is not a pot you just pour water into, stick lid on and fire up the burners.  But once you learn how to take care of it and use it I think you will be extremely pleased with the cooking experience. And the time spent learning and caring for the cooker will pay off in shorter and better cooking.  For those willing to invest a little time, bon appetite!\n",

      "About once a month,  I devote an entire day to making large batches of stews, soups, etc.. in my slower cooker, pressure cook  and on the stove in various large pots.  I then freeze them in smaller packages for future dinners.  These spoons arrived exactly on time for my cooking marathon today and got a good test run.It is hard to say anything new or original about measuring spoons, but here goes.....I tested them against other measuring spoons that I normally use and they appear to be accurate.  I like that the individual spoons snap off of the ring.  That way I don't have to fiddle around with the key ring circular type of holder or a little key chain or use what I need and then have to wash the entire set - not that that is a big deal, but I do like the option of easily separating them.I love that the set contains 1/8 teaspoon and 1/2 Tablespoon measures - very practical and convenient.  I also like the non slip surface.So far the one con and thus only a four star rating, is that the colored measurements on each spoon are small and a little difficult to read, especially on the smaller spoons.I have read numerous reviews which state that the colored measurement wears off rather quickly, even with hand washing. Only time will tell if this will happen to my set, hopefully not, but I will have to deal with that if and when  it happens.The spoons are like all OXO products, study and feel good in my hand.  All things being equal, I am very pleased with these spoons and I look forward to using them frequently.\n",

Unfortunately, with the Melitta, it was not to be for all I got was a cup of hot brown water.  Now, I am not the smartest guy in the world, but I ain't the dumbest either.

When you receive them, you will think they are the most adorable kitchen item you have ever seen. They are made in Germany and have a 3-year warranty.The pans are easy to close and release as they have a nice large clamp on the sides. This makes them perfect for mini cheesecakes. Molten chocolate cakes also sound delicious. For a party, you might want to order more than one box. These pans fit nicely on a baking sheet and you could bake six to a sheet. You could adapt your recipe so you fill these less and then they would make 1 elegant serving per guest for a party.I was surprised not to find recipes included with the pans, but there are plenty of recipes you could adapt. Just keep the temperature the same and decrease the time. The recipe I have was in the Sunset magazine and called for 10 \"tart\" pans (4 1/2 inch wide with removable rims). The cheesecakes bake at 325 degrees for 20-25 minutes so that might give you an idea of how you can adapt your own recipe.~The Rebecca Review\n",

      "I am a baking fool who lives alone and I love Bundt cake.I'm also a fool for collecting high quality bakeware and now that I have discovered Nordic Ware, I will collect no other.  How thrilled I was to find this Nordic Ware Platinum Collection Bundtlette pan for such a great price recently!  I really didn't need another Bundtlette pan - I already own theWilton Excelle Elite 6-Cup Mini Fluted Panwhich has served me well enough - but this Nordic Ware pan is vastly superior to the Wilton.I'm a vegan who can't have gluten containing ingredients so I also enjoy testing new gluten-free vegan cake recipes. A typical Bundt cake however is too large and way too much for me alone so I prefer making smaller, individual serving cakes I can enjoy by myself, share with my mother - who is my best taste-tester, or freeze for future satisfaction of my wicked sweet tooth.This Nordic Ware 6 bundtlette pan is perfect for my mini-Bundt cake experiments. The presentation is beautifully detailed, requires no additional decoration which tends to add on unnecessary extra calories, and it is the way to go for portion control! Since most Bundt cake recipes are for 10-12 cups, I would suggest buying two of these pans to accommodate your standard recipe and be sure not to fill each cavity more than 3/4 full. Baking time for these mini-Bundts is about 20-25 minutes in a 350 oven.This Bundtlette pan gets a real work-out in my kitchen and for the sake of comparison I have to say that my similar Wilton mini-Bundt pan after several baking projects in a 350 oven has warped slightly and now easily gets dinged, dented and scratched. Wilton bakeware is manufactured in China. Nordic Ware however is made in the USA. Its heavy cast aluminum provides unfailing baking performance. My cakes rise evenly, cook uniformly, are exquisitely detailed, have deliciously golden crusts, and never stick when released from the pan. The pan is made of heavy duty, non-stick walls and clean up is always a snap.  I hand wash with a soft dishcloth after soaking in hot soapy water for about 20 minutes. And Nordic Ware never warps or gets dented and scratched.This is another treasured piece of superior bakeware that will definitely endure the test of time and heavy use. Then I'll pass it down as an heirloom to my baking loved ones when I throw in my apron. Nordic Ware has never let me down and keeps on delighting me with every beautiful piece of bakeware that I add to my collection of specialty baking pans. Made in the USA Nordic Ware has become a name I can always trust never to fail me.\n",

We tried all sorts of different scrubbing devices to clean all of those potatoes, and every single one either didn't clean well, had flattened bristles within a month, or was just hugely uncomfortable and sometimes painful.  This made cleaning potatoes the biggest dread in the kitchen. So after I stopped being able to make my husband clean every single potato every time, I started looking for a new, fancy potato scrubber that I wouldn't bloody my knuckles using.  Money was no object (within reason, I wasn't going to justify $1000 for a brush) because this was going to be the most important purchase of the year.  I shopped vigorously online, read dozens of reviews, and finally decided on the OXO Good Grips Flexible Vegetable Brush.We've had it now for several months.  It is very comfortable to hold (even for people with giant freak hands like me), it does a good job of cleaning the potatoes, and best of all not one single bristle has even begun to flatten.  I no longer refuse to scrub my potatoes, so I don't think its stretching to say that this little brush has helped strengthen my relationship.  It really is fantastic, and I have nothing bad to say about it.  Totally worth the $8, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has to scrub vegetables.  Even if it eventually does flatten out on me, its already lasted at least 3x as long as any other brush I've tried.\n",

      "I went out to my local Lowe's today and bought a few fan to test out.  They had this exact same model and contrary to what people are saying here, it DOES NOT move a large volume of air.I'm not saying that people here are lying or work for Lasko, but maybe they have just never had 3 diff models to test side by side.  At the local store, they had the CFM ratings of each fan but this model wasn't listed, nor was any CFM rating found on the box.  It's CFM rating is probably low so the Lasko probably doesn't want to advertise it.Of the 3 models I tested, I kept the Feature Comforts model which moves about 3000 CFM of air.  I live in a 4000 sq ft home and bought these to flush out the hot air when I get home from work so I can cool the house w/AC faster.  I tested the fans by setting them up in the windows on the same wall and stepped back from the windows as far as I could till I could no longer feel the air being moved by each fan.The Lasko model pushed air about 7ft till I could no longer feel anything.  The Feature Comforts model pushed the air 29ft.  The Feature Comforts model also had the most uniform airflow w/o any \"dead spots\" near the center of the airstream.I would advise anyone to goto your local store and try the same, it costed me less than $70 to try the models I was interested in.  The only problem is the hassle of boxing up the ones that didn't perform well and the cost of gas for returning it.The Feature Comforts model number is 184705 and is an 18\" fan.  It's amazing that it can push 4x more air than the 20\" Lasko model.  Unfortunately, it's not on their website but it is available locally for only $24.Hopefully, Lasko will read this review and improve their fans and have an indepedent lab rate its CFM and put it on the box for educated consumers.\n",

      "I received this machine as a gift from my wish list, I wanted it because at the time it had received fairly great reviews from users.  I have a couple of problems with it though.First the loaf pan was difficult to remove the first couple of times I used it.  Secondly, one of the reviewers mentioned that it does not bake the top half of loaves that are larger than 1 lb.  That is true.  I made the zucchini bread recipe from their cookbook, the top half did not bake properly, I let it bake an additional 10-15 minutes, this ended up overcooking the bottom half of the loaf with no apparent progress on top.  Also when I made the standard 2 lb white loaf, it didn't bake a small portion of it at at the top.Either way I still use it quite a bit to make doughs and it works great for the most part.  I tend to stick to making more 1 lb loaves though.  Still it does a great job otherwise. I use it several times a week.\n",

The ice cream maker makes 1-1/2 quarts which is more than enough for my husband and I to enjoy. It's quick, easy and contains less preservatives than store bought.The only issue I have with it is the mixing attachment is made of plastic. It feels like it has to be handled very gingerly or it will snap in two. At times I am concerned that I will make an ice cream that is too thick for it to handle.

      "Our experience with this corer/slicer has been the same as many reviewers here.The initial trick with this device is aiming so that it actually slices through the core, rather than to one side.  Since apples are seldom perfect, this sometimes requires a bit of cleverness.  If the core is missed, then a small paring knife may be needed to remove seeds, etc, from some of the slices.We have also noticed two other things noted by other reviewers:1.  The device doesn't always cut cleanly all the way through the bottom of the apple.  This is probably a function of the cutting surface.  Often it is necessary to pull the core and/or some of the segments through the device by hand.  It is better to grip each segment and pull it through, rather than try to push on the skin at the bottom, which could lead to cut fingers.2.  The white outer ring on ours has cracked where one of the blade \"spokes\" meets the ring.  So far this hasn't affected the unit's operation, but I am assuming that it will fail at that point some day.The good news is that Oxo stands behind its products, and I expect that if and when this unit fails, Oxo will replace it.All in all, a good choice for this purpose, even if not perfect.  It's still much faster than manually cutting apple slices, and probably safer.\n",

      "I love roast duck but no matter what I've tried I've never able to manage a juicy duck with crispy skin (the best part!!) in the oven.  Yesterday I used my Ronco rotisserie for the first time to cook a 7# (Maple Leaf Farms) duck and it was fantastic -- nice and juicy and every inch of skin was crispy.  For duck lovers, I rubbed it with paprika, used a very sharp knife to cut slits all over the duck so the fat could drain off (ducks are VERY fatty), put it on the spit, set the rotisserie for 1:45 (7 lbs x 15 min/lb) as recommended and then checked it with a meat thermometer when it shut off.  Internal temp was right where it should have been so I brushed on the orange sauce that comes with the duck. let it heat/rotate for another 7 minutes, let it rest for about 10 minutes, and then started carving.  Best duck I've ever had at home or in a restaurant!!!  (Surprisingly, leftovers brushed with orange sauce and reheated in my convection oven at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes were just as good today as yesterday's meal.)  A couple notes. I lined the drip tray and drip cover with aluminum foil and even though a lot of fat had been collected in both, clean-up was a breeze.  I sprayed the back reflector shield with Pam as others recommended and it came out scorched and black. Scrubbing it with a scouring pad did next to nothing so I sprayed it with Easy Off heavy-duty oven cleaner, put it in the rotisseries overnight and this morning it wiped clean, good as new!  I can't speak yet to the durability of this rotisserie but I highly recommend it to duck lovers everywhere.  (Sorry, Donald and Daisy :-)\n",

I should mention that the manufacturer recommends hand washing and I do not have a dishwasher so this was not an issue for me.First impression was good. The metal is not thin and they are strong and hold their shape. The measurements were easy to read and were not mismarked (some reviewers mention receiving mismarked measurements).The INDIFFERENT: The little pour spouts on the side of the cups seem like a good idea but in actual application are 100% uselessThe GOOD: These nest into each other quite well. The elliptical shape allows for easier scooping from bags and jars. The clasp ring that holds them together makes it easy to remove/replace individual cups when needed.The BAD: I have already had one of the handles fall off the cup. I assume this is due to poor welding of the stainless. There is no warranty on the product and they are not available for purchase as individual cups so you have to buy a whole new set. Because of this, in my opinion, if one thing breaks I consider the entire set broken.What I expect is fair price that reflect the quality of the product as well as on time delivery.

      "Nearly a week was spent looking through feature sets, reading reviews, and considering price points when I finally decided on the Breadman Ultimate T2200C. That decision was made just under a year ago. Waiting a year to leave my review was intentional; I understand the draw of new, shiny toys and in all the excitement, it's easy to lead prospective buyer's astray with incomplete reviews. That said, let's get started.Being a bread making novice, I found the included instructional video to be invaluable, though it might have been prudent to include a DVD as opposed to VHS tape, considering current technology trends. Watching it once was enough to get started making my first perfect loaf of bread. It showed precisely how to add the ingredients, gave some tips for better bread making, and went over the general functions of the machine.Things were glorious for the first few months, the aroma of fresh bread wafting through the house. Making, on average, one to two loaves per week, I became known as the bread lady. People were coming from far and wide to sample my goods. (OK, maybe not far *and* wide, but I did get nick-named the bread lady.)Then, the problems started...One morning while some dough was kneading, I heard a loud clang and suddenly it sounded as though bombs were going off in my kitchen. Springing up from my office chair and sprinting to the kitchen, I saw that the bread pan had come loose and the machine was jostling itself perilously close to my counter's edge.After pausing the machine, repositioning it, and pressing the bread pan back in place, all seemed well again. Too bad it didn't stay that way for long. Future incidents increased and soon, the bread pan refused to properly lock in place. This significantly impacted the amount of bread I made, which dropped down to one to two loaves *per month*. A year later, the bread pan staying in place is truly a hit or miss.With Thanksgiving nearing, I decided it would be nice to have fresh bread with our turkey. The Breadman decided otherwise. I plugged in the machine and nothing happened. The beep of mechanical life was absent and the screen was totally blank. I tried pressing buttons and followed the instructions in the manual (which are really vague when it comes to this problem), yet nothing. (This wasn't the first time, either. Though, I should be clear, the previous cases were few, sporadic and non-disruptive.)The day before Thanksgiving and my bread machine refused to even acknowledge the presence of electricity -- I was beside myself. Many people were promised fresh bread and I surely wasn't about to touch a conventional oven.  My only recourse was to head out into holiday traffic and snag a $40 deal from Wal-Mart -- nowhere near the same quality of bread, unfortunately.Suddenly, after allowing it to sit unplugged for another three days, it sprang back to life. Unfortunately, it did so with a customer service rep on the phone and it left me with a bit of egg on my face. No matter, I discussed the issue of the unstable bread pan and she gave me some tips. Basically, she said it was my fault - or rather, my bread dough's fault. Funny, considering my bread dough hasn't changed *at all* (I use the exact same recipe each time) in the year I've been using the bread machine.At the end of the day, the bread machine still works, but I don't know for how long, the bread pan is unstable, and the customer service was unable to do anything for me after the 10 minute wait to speak with a human. One would think that a year's use from a bread machine that costs $xx is a pretty good value, but it's not the case. By my calculations, when I consider the cost of the machine, ingredients and the number of loaves I've made, it comes out to be just under $10/loaf. Had I known that was the value I'd be getting, I'd have stuck with store bought for $3/loaf.Although the machine makes absolutely beautiful bread, the cost versus quality just doesn't stand up to the test of time. If you plan to make a number of fancy breads, need a machine that produces amazing baking results, or can justify the high cost per loaf, this is a great tool. But be aware that it may not stand up to the test of time or the wear and tear.\n",

I probably would have been OK with just a 12-Quart but I'm glad that I got a 16-Quart because it has plenty of room.I read reviews of several products and this one had great reviews. As others have said, it has a nice solid base and does not burn food on the bottom. Another thing I really like is that it does not have rivets. I kept reading that in other reviews and had to look-up what that meant. So in case you're not a cookware expert either, rivets are when the handles are bolted to the pot and you have those little round fasteners on the inside of the pot. The reason I don't like rivets is that food tends to get stuck in them.The instructions do say that it's dishwasher safe, they also say it may lose it's shininess after dishwashing.

This not only makes the cups slightly harder to hold; they feel unbalanced when full.The rubber coverings on the handles will melt or burn if the cups are used to heat liquid ingredients on the stove, which is one of the main advantages of sturdy metal measuring cups.The cups could be used more flexibly if there were also metal markings on the sides, to divide the one cup into halves, thirds, and quarters, and the half cup into quarters. This would enable you to pre-measure, say, two different quarter cups of ingredients accurately without having to get out yet another measuring cup from some other set.Overall, it's not a bad set of measuring cups but I am glad I already have a burner-proof set with longer handles, plus plastic four-cup and two-cup measuring cups.\n",

I was mid-way cutting up a cheesecake for serving when it snapped.When I searched for a replacement, I found OXO now offers two models. Since I'd already tried the other, I chose this one as it's replacement. And, bonus, it's a dollar less.Compared to the other, the two main differences are that this one doesn't have as flashy a handle (less embellishment) and the connection between the handle and spade is not as flexible.The serrated edges make cutting cakes and pies easy and it is plenty flexible enough to slide easily under the piece of dessert and pull it out for serving.\n",

I've owned them for about 6 years and use them about once or twice a month. The handles may look like they are glued on but I believe it is an electrical weld, or at least that is what a mechanic told me he thought it was.I would not consider them to be flimsy or light weight, but they are not heavy duty either. I consider them to be basic middle of the road measuring cups. Worth what I paid. To me these are worth about $8 to $10 but not much more.I am careful with stainless steel, as some manufacturers take short cuts and use low quality ingredients in their stainless (you will see pitting if it's low quality or poorly made). I see nothing that would indicate this is low quality stainless steel. It is highly polished and has no pitting. I'm surprised at the quality since they are made in China and due to so many Chinese manufacturers making low quality (even dangerous or toxic) products I usually don't buy or use anything made in China. But, on close inspection I am happy with the quality of these cups.If I were a professional baker or if I expected to use my measuring cups every day I would invest in a better set that are one piece (the handles are not welded on but are part of the cup) since that would make them very strong. Like theseAmco Advanced Performance Measuring Cup Set. Or I'd get the kind that have the handles riveted on, like theseAll-Clad Stainless Measuring Cup Set. But again, these Amco Basic's are just fine for my purposes (for the average cook), and I don't want to spend $25 to $50 on measuring cups (and many cannot afford that).My only wish is that they had a 1/8 cup to make it a set of 5.

Maybe it's due to my age (not telling) or my small hands, but I yet find it very awkward to hold a potato in my hand and peel each end and side of the potato using this peeler without nearly slicing a portion of my hand or fingers in the process. One has to hold a potato \"just so\" in order to peel the potato properly. If not careful, the potato will slip out of your hand or you will slice the side of your thumb, finger or palm. I've actually sliced myself once and \"almost\" a few times too many since I've had this peeler, although I had never had any issues with any other peeler.

      "I bought this machine many years ago. My family thought I was nuts to spend so much money on an ice cream machine. And I admit, I was wondering at first if I had gone a bit overboard myself. But I have never regretted purchasing it ever since.This machine is a joy to use and makes making your own homemade ice cream a breeze. You mix the ingredients, put them in the machine, set the timer, and start it up. In about 30 minutes you have ice cream. If you are like me, you have ice cream made from organic ingredients.Cleanup is a little tricky. The big plus is that the bowl is smooth, rounded stainless steel--very easy to get clean and sanitary. The minus is that the bowl is integrated with the body of the machine, so you can't take it out. The plus side of that integration, however, is that there are no cracks or seams where particles can linger and rot, so I don't mind this one drawback.The machine doesn't make a lot of ice cream at a time, and the ice cream comes out pretty soft when it is done. You need to let it sit in your freezer to harden it up a bit. (I think it is possible to leave the ice cream in the machine with just the compressor running, but I haven't tried that.)However, if you want more ice cream, you can make one batch after another sequentially, and if you are making the same flavor, you don't need to clean the machine in between batches.I personally love this machine because my favorite ice cream flavor is peppermint, but I can't get it commercially except during the winter (where the robins bask). With this machine, I've developed my own delicious peppermint ice cream recipe, so I can enjoy its refreshing flavor any time of year. Oh, and my own green tea ice cream recipe beats any commercial green tea ice cream.If you are looking for good recipes for this machine, tryBen & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream & Dessert Book, which is the best ice cream recipe book I've used. One warning is that many of these recipes use raw eggs. If you don't want to use raw eggs in your ice cream, you can make a cooked custard-style ice cream, or use the no-egg recipes fromThe Ultimate Ice Cream Book : Over 500 Ice Creams, Sorbets, Granitas, Drinks, And More.\n",

Then looked at the display: 240 grams.

So when the cup is sitting on a flat surface the top is at a slight angle.  It's subtle and unlikely to be a problem in most cases, but it seems less than ideal.Quality wise these are great, made from a single, hefty piece of metal with a nice handle.My other minor gripe is that the hook on the end of each and the ring that they all clip to is ugly and annoying.

      "I bought this little pot after I tasted perked coffee at a private, catered brunch.  The caterer had one of those big, cheap old-fashioned percolators.  I poured a cup, took a sip and OMG!  That was the BEST cup of coffee I have ever had!  I asked him if it was the brand of coffee he was using and he said no, that it was just regular coffee but that the percolator made a difference.Anyway, I bought the Farberware 4-cup since I would be making coffee for myself only most mornings.  I've been  using it for about 9 months.  Well, this morning I plug it up and nothing happens.  I check the connections and they seem to be ok.  I unplug the cord from the pot and replug, nothing.  So then I had to dump out the water and coffee.  After examining the pot, I heard something jingling inside.  I looked at the bottom and noticed that one of the little metal prongs where the plug plugs into the pot was gone.  It's inside the bottom of the damn pot!  Evidently those prongs deteriorate and then break off.I want to get the 4-cup repaired, but I will probably have to spend the same as it would cost to buy a new one.  This doesn't seem cost effective to me.  Plus, if Farberware is cutting corners using cheaper parts, then they should lower the cost of the pot!What I did like about this pot is that it heated very quickly.  It took about 2 minutes to brew 4 cups.  The coffee tasted fine.  The one drawback is that the pot does not turn off.  You MUST unplug it immediately after you pour (if you have memory lapses).  If you forget to unplug it, the pot will continue to heat and burn up all residue left inside.Oh, one more thing.  If you use regular ground store-bought coffee, you will have \"mud\" at the bottom of your cup.  You would probably need to grind your own beans more coarsely to eliminate the mud or use a paper coffee filter inside the basket.  I just tolerate the mud.\n",

Otherwise mine is identical and I wouldn't be able to function in the kitchen without it. I've had mine for about 3 or 4 years - maybe longer - time flies. I saw where only a few reviewers were disappointed. I don't understand how that could be possible. Like another reviewer, I grew tired of electric can openers that eventually wouldn't hold onto the can while cutting the lid or the blade would become dull or bent so it was useless. Also, got tired of taking up counter space. I don't think anyone will be sorry for buying this can opener. It's well worth every penny.\n",

      "I have three Nordic Ware Bundt pans now and a mini Bundt pan that I haven't used yet and I don't know how I ever baked without them. They are quite lovely and look good hanging on a wall but that is not why I bought them.They release the cake; easily. Give the cake a few minutes to cool, invert onto a cooling grid and voila! The cake comes out of the pan all in one piece and the cake surface has a lovely polished look to it.They cook evenly. My older pans had many faults such as under cooking around the center, sticking no matter what I did to grease and flour them and sometimes burning. Not with these.They clean up easily. Despite being dishwasher unfriendly they come clean quickly with hot water and a wipe and then are ready for another round of baking. When the day is done they go back to a hook on the wall to look pretty.I read that Nordic Ware was first to introduce the Bundt pan in the States. Their expertise shows. I will likely never use another brand of Bundt pan.\n",

It works quickly with not toomuch effort but you must keep an even pressure near theend so the lid completely cuts off.  Yes, unfortunately,the lid does fall into the food but my mother taught mewhen I was a child to always wipe off the can lid witha wet paper towel before opening it.  I would have preferreda can opener that leaves a smooth edge but I've had verynegative results with several of that type.  Every one Ihad left slivers of the can label, or even worse, sliversof metal which got into the food.  No thanks.

This is a good, sturdy can opener which is easyto use and should hold up for many years.

      "My first popcorn popper survived over ten years of twice-a-week popping until my 10-yr-old dropped the lid and broke it.  When I first read about the Stir Crazy, I thought it was a gimmick.  One more thing to break - but I ordered one anyway because there wasn't much selection.  What a great move!  Microwave popcorn is convenient, but it has a tendency to burn if you don't watch it.  The Stir Crazy is great.  Dribble some oil in, add my favorite &quot;premium&quot; popcorn, plug it in, and pretty much every kernel pops every time.  Like others, I leave the top open to let the steam escape so that the popcorn is more tender - I flip and empty the popper as soon as the popping stops for the same reason - and the results are reliably great.  Use that idle microwave to melt the butter.  A quick swirl with the OXO Nylon Palm Soap Brush, and the parts are clean.  By the way, the revolving arm does wear off a circle of the non-stick stuff, but that's what the raised ring is supposed to do (it sacrifices itself to protect the main popping surface)!So, I started skeptical, sad to have lost my reliable popper, but there's no looking back for me.\n",

I hope this is OK.This spatula (and it's slightly smaller brother) replaces my Oxo SteeL spatula for pancakes and eggs. I'm pretty new in the kitchen so I'm just learning what works for me and what doesn't.The SteeL product line is nice. I don't have a bad thing to say about them. In particular the SteeL spatula is pretty heavy duty and well built. The problem is the blade is pretty thick which means I bulldoze pancakes and eggs and make a bit of a mess with the SteeL spatula.I can't remember how I found this one - ATK maybe? But after reading the reviews here I purchased it and this morning gave it a try. The blade feels kind of flimsy and is very thin. It bends easily and if you are too rough with it I believe it would permanently crease without much effort. However, for flipping pancakes and eggs it is perfect! It slides under the pancakes with no bulldozing and after the flip the pancake looks perfect.If I'm flipping hamburgers I'll use the SteeL spatula but for delicate breakfast foods like eggs and pancakes the Good Grips Flexible Spatula the right tool for the job.\n",

They are sturdy, heavy aluminum and the handles make it so much easier to handle and arrange hot pans in the oven than the older pans without handles. Nordic Ware made excellent products thirty years ago when I bought my first full-sized Bundt pan, and they continue to make excellent products today. And they're made in the USA!I had been avoiding baking my favorite Bundt-style cakes because the cakes were simply too large to use up in a reasonable amount of time. Now with two of these mini-pans I can make one recipe, dividing the batter evenly between them and end up with one small cake to freeze or give away and another for immediate use. Perfect! It wouldn't be difficult to halve a recipe to make only enough batter for one cake as an alternative.The first cake I tried baking in these was a chocolate pound cake (check verybestbaking.com and search for Rich Chocolate Pound Cake if you'd like the recipe) and they came out beautifully. The cakes released from the pans easily without damage after cooling and looked terrific. Just remember to adjust the baking times to account for less batter. I found for this pound cake, for example, 35-40 minutes in a 350 degree (Fahrenheit) oven was perfect as opposed to the 55 to 65 minutes for a full sized cake as suggested in the recipe.\n",

      "Please note that I have several Henckel knives that I really like, so this is definitely not a anti-Henckel biased review.There is really only one problem with this knife - the blade is way too thick.  If there's only one problem - then why do I give it only one star?  Well, this one problem completely ruins this knife.  The 'eversharp' name I'm sure refers to the fact that the serrations are not the standard \"wave pattern\" you'd see on most bread knives. Instead, each serration has several smaller serrations and spikes built in. I know that this is supposed to ensure that the knife will never end up dull - but in the process it makes it horrible at doing any kind of delicate cutting. Plus, the blade is not flexible in any way due to the extreme thickness. Unless you are cutting the sturdiest bread out there, you'll crush it while trying to slice with this blade. Forget about cutting any kind of soft bread or pastry. I've found that some of our cheap steak knives work far better than this knife.I've come to the conclusion that this knife is horrible after comparing it to two other bread knives I now own. The first was a Paderno (small Canadian company) that we got for our wedding, and the second was a Global bought from Amazon. Both are considerably more expensive than this knife, but there are other, more economical options out there that are still far better. You want to find a nice, thin blade with even and sharp serrations. If you're looking to stay in this price range, you won't find anything forged - these will all be stamped or laser cut - but that's fine - the bread knife doesn't need to be strong like your chef's knife.Pros:-CheapCons:-Mashes your bread while it cuts-Hard to get started through crusts due to blade thickness-The 'spiky' serrations are dangerous to your fingers (think many tiny needles along the blade) - they tend to nick you easily - but they are useless for their intended purpose of cutting bread.Suggestion: Steer clear. If you can afford it, get a Global (or even a better Henckel). Otherwise, look for a the thin stamped blade.\n",

It's heavier than I expected; the metal is thick.  It's the heaviest wok of four or five I've owned.  I am happy with the wooden handles.  The helper handle makes more sense now, considering the weight of the wok.  I won't be flipping this one.Now I've owned it a while and used it several times.  I'm unhappy.  The wok is well made but it doesn't get hot enough on my American gas stove.  I tried turning the ring upside down but that didn't work.  I have to remove the burner grill to do it and then the ring slides around on the stove and the wok is in contact with the burner, not the ring, and it rocks around.  No good.  It's a high quality piece of cookware that just doesn't work on my stove.  I guess eventually I'll try the flat bottomed 14 inch wok as is recommended by many for American stoves.  I'm beginning the think the real problem is the stove just won't give enough heat and no wok will work very well.  For now, my cast iron skillet works better than a wok but I don't like it's weight or shape so much, for stir frying.\n",

You will find yourself reading it over and over, makign flowers over and over. You will see that your self-esteem will roar! People, co-workers, family members, friends will be dazzled and amazed -- and so will YOU.  This lesson book is extremely valuable. It cannot be purchased from Wilton (which is a real crying shame). I think Wilton is afraid that if they sell the book, they will miss out of selling classes, but not so.  I, myself, took 4 classes. Having bakes/cooked since the age of 9, I really didn't feel it was necessary but boy was I surprised. I learned more in my first class than I had in years of teaching. Wilton honestly needs to sell these lesson plans.  Not only will receive money from the classes, but they will also make money from the books.  Why would a company prefer their customers buy their books from someone else??? I've not figured that out.  Getting back to this lesson book...you will be extremely, extremely happy.  Your family will brag on you.  Your income will increase for making beautiful live-appearing flowers that you sell on your cakes. Please try it...you cannot fail!!!

I don't see them denting anytime soon.The handle grip is also a nice addition. The metal measuring cups we used previously had a metal only handle and it just wasn't as nice or as good to grip as the OXO.

      "I recently replaced an Orville Redenbacher Popcorn Popper which I owned for over a year with this Stir Crazy unit. Quite honestly, both poppers are so similar that they might be interchangeable except for their logos.Operation is easy. Plug the Stir Crazy into an electric socket, pour in the popping oil, add the popcorn, put on the lid on, and watch the magic happen. An arm rotates at the bottom of the popper which distributes the popcorn and effectively eliminates the need to shake the popcorn in hot oil. If you use the butter dispenser, the popcorn will be evenly coated with butter without getting soggy or excessively greasy.The unit is easy to clean after it has presumably cooled down after being unplugged. It is not submersible so I use dampened paper towels to clean and dry the unit. The bowl and lid need to be hand washed in warm, soapy water and air or hand dried.My only issue with this unit and my old Redenbacher popper is the plastic bowl. Because they are made of a hard plastic the bowls seem to be predisposed to hairline cracks. This unit's bowl already shows fracturing as did my old popper. The bowl just isn't particularly durable even when it is gently hand washed. This might not be a huge issue if the bowl wasn't essential to operation. While for me this isn't a deal breaker because this popper makes really good popcorn, it would be nice if they could come up with a sturdier bowl.Overall, this is a nice popper that is reasonably priced.\n",

      "We do a lot of cooking in our home, so we've done plenty with measuring cups.  Plastic cups, metal cups--even glass measuring cups.  After working with so many different types, you do tend to get a feel for the types  that work the best and wind up standing the test of time.  OXO's Good Grips Measuring Cups are stainless steel with soft grip plastic handle with the measurement of the cup printed on the top of the handle.  The set comes with 4 different measurement cups, sizes 1 Cup, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4.  All four attach to a sturdy plastic ring.Sturdy and easy to clean, these are a fantastic addition to our kitchen.  Unlike plastic sets that tend to stain over time, these do not take on the coloring of the foodstuffs measured out--even tomato based items and turmeric.  While we do not own a dishwasher, these are supposedly dishwasher safe with measurement labels that will not rub off after heavy use.  Whether these numerical labels will last over time remains to be seen.  So far, so good.  The deep cups allow for easy scooping--it's easier to get the full amount in one go than it is when the cup is shallow.What we really love is the ability to hang  these cups up by their main ring.  We can detach each cup in turn and put them back on without opening the ring or pulling off every measuring  cup.  The cups don't come off super easy, but that's a plus since you don't want to dislodge all the cups accidentally. My only real complaint may be that the set does not come with a 3/4 size measurement--though often these days it's hard to find a set that does.A sturdy and practical product for everyday kitchen measuring.Happy cooking! ^_^ Shanshad\n",

It had pitted in several places, to the point that there was a patch of aluminum showing through the stainless steel bottom. I didn't want aluminum in my food, so after I determined that it would take 6 weeks to obtain action on the &#34;limited lifetime warranty&#34; and the pot wasn't available anymore, I decided to try this one, which is sold by the same company. I used it once to make stock and it pitted and discolored after the first use, so it had to go back for a refund. It was also lighter weight than the Anolon one, didn't heat as quickly, and it took a higher heat setting to maintain the simmer at the right level to make good stock. I am surprised at the number of high marks given by other reviewers. In addition, the Anolon pot had the handles bolted onto the sides and lid and this one had thin stainless steel loops spot welded on, so I was very worried that one of the handles on the side would come off while I was lifting a pot full of hot stock and burn myself. I never had that problem with the Anolon pot, and I am sorry I have to replace it at this time.After I returned this pot, I bought a Tramontina 16 qt. stock pot and had to return it, too, as it was already pitted on the bottom, right out of the package. It also was lighter in weight than the Anolon pot, so I am hoping that the Concord stock pot I just ordered will do better than any of these. I asked a question before buying it around this issue of pitting and one person wrote back immediately that she never has that problem with that pot. I hope I won't either!\n",

I have been getting by with a small DeLonghi Safeheat, but wanted something taller to provide heat to my upper body.  I also suffer from hot flashes so I needed something that oscillated.I didn't read any reviews here first.  Just went by my co-worker's glowing praise for hers.  She does sit in an office and I don't.  However, the features seemed to fit my bill.I am quite happy with the heater.  I appreciate the different heat and fan settings.  The oscillation works as I'd hoped - not concentrating the heat right on me.  It keeps me warmer and cuts the draft from the windows.

I just need my area warm enough to work in without a coat.There are only two drawbacks for me so far: the heater vents are about 5 or 6 inches up off the floor so the heat doesn't keep my feet warm.

      "My first use of this steamvac on my light-gray berber carpet was on the red clay stains just inside the door, and old yellowed cat barf spots that were impervious to all the carpet cleaners and home remedies I had tried previously.  The steamvac cleaned it all up beautifully!Since the nozzle on this unit is only four inches wide, it took a while to do the whole area by the door (maybe 30 minutes for 20 square feet), but the smaller spots took no time.  Once I got used to the motion of cleaning it went more quickly.  You do two 'wet' passes while holding the trigger, which squirts out the hot water and cleaning solution in a fan pattern; then a few 'dry' passes (sans trigger) to suction up the water...you can see through the clear nozzle when there is no more water being taken up. The suction is quite powerful and leaves the carpet just a tad damp... my carpet dried in about an hour.The steamvac is light and easy to carry around, even when full of water.  It has an easy-access fill port on top for putting in the cleaning solution and hot water (which I heated in a glass pitcher in my microwave).  There is an auto shutoff feature when the separate recovery tank (which holds the used water) gets full, and a spout on the side through which you empty out the dirty water.  When I dumped out the recovery tank I was astonished at how much dirt had been in my carpet, even though I'd vacuumed thoroughly before using the steamvac!This little unit does make big noise, but I think that's due to the powerful suction.  I don't consider the noise level a drawback. It's a lot less expensive and a lot more convenient than renting the Rug Doctor or calling in the professional rug cleaners for a few dirty spots.I am SO glad I bought this!\n",

      "I purchased this set of measuring cups after I accidentally threw away a 1/2 C measure from a separate stainless steel set.  Plus, a very good friend of mine recommended them.So far, I'm happy with them.Pros:  The cups nest well whether they're attached to the ring or not.  They also sit completely flat.  The measurement markings are bright and clear, and after owning them for about a month -- I have not seen anything that would suggest that they were fading or will fade as other customers have suggested.  Even if that were to happen, the measurement markings are slightly raised and stamped ONTO the handles, and would be readable without the colored paint.  The 3/4 C measure is great, and eliminates a lot of unnecessary measuring compared to a 1/4 C measure.  The inside of each cup also features a halfway line, which is convenient when you're measuring liquids and only need half the amount the cup measures.Cons:  My only complaint has to do with the storage ring, which is rather large and takes up a lot of drawer space.  When attached to the ring, the cups are also harder to use, so if you purchase these, you'd be better off storing them individually and throwing the ring into your junk drawer.If you need a better look at these cups before deciding whether or not to purchase them, visit Oxo's official website [...]\n",

      "If you mainly use a food processor, or WANT to use a food processor for blending, chopping and pureeing foods, the Mini-Prep is such a good idea. It does about 80 percent of what a large food processor does, and it's easier to clean and takes up less space.If you find you typically chop herbs, make pesto and blended sauces, herb butters and the like and do NOT use the food processor for batters, doughs and slicing, you might consider the Mini-Prep. The motor is very strong, the blade very sharp. I made a fresh tomato coulis out of tomato, dried tomato, oil and herbs in seconds and it had the right texture (chopped but not liquified.)One thing I hate about large food processors is scraping small amounts of chopped herbs or nuts out of the large bowl. If your typical job, like mine, is chopping small items in smaller quantities, this is perfect. It takes up a lot less space on the counter, too.The unit comes in steel color and white. Before you buy a food processor, consider what you typically process. If you do coffee, smoothies, pesto, chopped herbs and nuts and salsa, this may just be enough, saving you dollars and space.\n",

The recipes in the instruction book work just fine.A bit of advice;1)Read the instructions carefully.2)Plan for some lead time.  You need to have the bowl completely frozen. (If you need to make more than one batch at a time, you can buy an extra freezer bowl.)3)Bear in mind that the ice cream will still be soft when the machine is done with it. (This is true with most ice cream machines.) You will still need to put it in the freezer for a while before serving.4)Indulge in high quality ingredients; for example, get some whole vanilla beans for your vanilla ice cream.

Since I love the OXO product line, in general, I knew I would love these.Basically I do, but there is only one very minor thing I would change.  The ring is not round, if the ring that holds the spoons together were round instead of oval it would be a lot easier for the spoons to glide around.Aside from the one minor flaw I find these spoons to be excellent.  There are 6 spoons, 1/8, 1/4. 1/2. and 1 tsp.  also 1/2 and 1 tbsp..  the most convenient sizes.the arms of the spoons are very hefty but mildly flexible and thick for easy griping. The spoons bowl is stiff to make sure your measurement is true and it is slick so the food being measured slides out easily. The best feature for me, and makes this set stand out, is the ability to easily remove the spoons from its ring to be able to take the spoon to the recipe and not have to lug around the hole set.All in all it find that these deliver what the company set out to do.Now I can use  set of measuring cups to match this set of spoons.\n",

      "We have several pans made by Chicago Metallic, and have been satisfied with their quality. The thickness of the metal make these shell pans very stiff, and they should endure many years of use. I'm unsure how long the non-stick coating will last but other reviewers have not expressed concerns after purchasing these 5+ years ago.While it has nothing to do with the pan itself, I was disappointed to find out that whole wheat and multi grain tortillas (La Tortilla Factory brand) did not bake well, and virtually inedible (turned rubbery). I tried several attempts precisely following the mfg. directions as well as trying other techniques found posted on the Internet . . . none made them crispy. I re-read most of the 43 reviews hoping to gain insight from others but nothing seemed on point. I then decided to buy some regular flour tortillas. They came out fine following the mfg. directions.I lightly sprayed oil on one pan and not the other, and neither tortilla stuck to the pan, and no noticeable taste difference. So the oil seems unnecessary.A 10-inch tortilla fully fits inside the pan. While I haven't tried one, I think a 14-inch tortilla should work fine even though it would probably extend about 2 inches above the top of pan.We're happy with these pans, and enjoy making tasty taco salads.\n",

This is important because other people in my household (teenagers and husband) have absolutely no regard for what can, and can not, go into the dishwasher (I've replaced at least two Tupperware ice cream scoops for that very reason - they pit terribly in the dishwasher). I wanted to make sure the knives would live through a few cycles knowing someone in my house would most certainly put them in despite any lecture I may give about them being hand wash only. However, the care instructions in the box say hand washing recommended - no where does it say dishwasher safe. Aside from that, the knives are stylish and sleek but are smaller and lighter than I expected. Doesn't appear to be a problem because they do cut wonderfully and that's what important.

      "I've owned other small Eurekas at my cabin and they have been dependable and long-lasting.  This Quick Up Cordless Vac is great.  While it's not a deep-cleaning vac it does what I bought it to do.....bare tile and hardwood floors.  The sand and grit hauled in by me and my dogs not only grinds on my nerves, it dulls floors.  The Eureka was easy to assemble, hang and use.  I can't comment on its durability yet. One very pleasant surprise is that it is small enough to fit under my bed foundation to get pet hair from a Sheltie (yuk) which I had much trouble reaching with the attachments on my Hoover. The extra battery pack was the final factor that caused me to purchase this.  For bare floors and very smooth rugs/carpets it performs very well.  At its price with battery packs, I'd recommend it highly  ADDITION Aug 2013: While I still like the Eureka and it does everything that a simple, cheap electric broom should do I've discovered one Achilles Heel for it.  The beater brush, used for rugs, winds up lots of rug fabric and thread around the yellow brushes.  There isn't a way to open the beater bar and clean it.  I phoned Eureka and was told that if you remove the four small screws in the head you can clean it BUT(!) you may not be able to reassemble it!  This was their confession.  Other than that annoying feature I am very satisfied with the Eureka Quick Up so far.UPDATE Mar, 2014:  This continues to be a very useful, economical product for my hardwood floors and short fiber carpet.  One hint for using on carpet---use two hands and instead of casually flipping the sweeper about like a mop....apply a little downward pressure with your non-dominant hand and bring the unit back SLOWLY to you.  This is especially helpful when doing a casual clean up of dog hair on the bedroom medium nap carpet.

      "This knife, and theJ.A. Henckels Twin Four Star 3-Inch High Carbon Stainless-Steel Paring Knifeare the two best knives in the Henckels four star collection.  There is something \"just so\" about them.  They are just right, with all the various design parameters coming together to create a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts.  This serrated utility knife works well in a great variety of applications.  The five inch serrated blade is nicely thin (but still thick enough for good strength and rigidity) and shallow (i.e. not broad).  I find it very useful for cutting pie or cake or brownies, as well as (of course) bread and tomatoes and many other vegetables.I've had this knife now for SIXTEEN YEARS, and it is still going strong, and still one of my favorites.  However . . . you must SHARPEN this knife eventually.  Like any other knife, it will go dull.  NEVER HONE THIS KNIFE OR ANY OTHER SERRATED KNIFE!  A sharpening steel is too large a diameter to be used on a serrated knife.  It will only round out the serrations and will not sharpen the knife.  This is NOT the fault of the knife.  It's inherent in the design.  In order to sharpen this knife, you need theSpyderco Sharpmaker Knife Sharpener 204MF.  This setup has triangular ceramic sticks, so you can use the edges (and ONLY the edges) of the rods to sharpen serrated knives. It works great.  Just make sure to read the directions or watch the video to ensure your technique is correct first.  But then a half an hour or so every year will be enough to keep this knife in good working order.  If you've already honed the heck out of a serrated knife, though, start over with a new one.  The Spyderco Sharpmaker won't perform miracles and add steel back onto the points of the serrations or anything!More generally, you need to realize that GOOD KNIVES NEED SHARPENING. Period. And a honing steel IS NOT \"sharpening\". That is honing, or touching up. Not the same. That will only make a good sharpening last a bit longer (although you're much better off with a ceramic hone or the Spyderco Sharpmaker for such touching up, by the way.)  To really resharpen a knife, you need a real sharpening system, or a stone and a lot of practice. I use the Edge Pro Apex for sharpening, and the Sypderco for touching up, and for sharpening serrated knives.If you never want to sharpen a knife, you don't want a knife. You want a SAW. Like the Ginsu knives that used to be on TV. These have small and deep and aggressive serrations that will last almost indefinitely, but the cutting action is very poor. They will do the job--and like almost forever--but no good chef would be pleased with the results.  So get that sort of thing if you don't want to sharpen your knives (or have them professionally sharpened at least once a year).  But don't complain about this one not lasting forever with improper (or no) maintenance.\n",

You don't really need the sextant and barometer to make a proper soft-boiled egg.)The Salton cooker has a nice egg rack that lifts out when the eggs are done. You can take the boiled eggs to the sink to cool them in water (halts the cooking, keeps you from burning your fingers.) The settings, however, are different than European. Soft is medium-soft (white done, yolk liquid) medium is a medium hard yolk, and hard is the harboildegg for picnics and salads. (Some European models have a soft setting that is a very liquid egg such as you'd use in Caesar salad dressing. This model does not have that setting.) This cooker will handle up to six eggs and comes with a water measure that has a piercing spike on the bottom in an egg-shaped depression. The egg fits in there for piercing the shell lightly, which is supposed to keep the shell from cracking uncontrollably during cooking.Warning: the top gets VERY hot during use, so lift it off by the small end over the handle ONLY.

      "I've owned my Breadman Ultimate for 6 years now.  It's my 3rd bread machine and by far the best.  I recently thought I had burned out the motor after the machine overheated trying to knead a very heavy whole grain sourdough.  However, after not working for 2 days, my machine is making perfect bread once again. I have no complaints at all about the machine.  I do advise everyone to accept the fact that they will need to \"babysit\" the machine during the first 10 or 15 minutes of kneading, to make sure that the dough is the right consistency. They may need to use a rubber spatula to scrape flour out of the corners of the bread pan and to add flour and/or water to achieve the perfect consistency.  After that, the machine will take care of the rest.My recommendations for books:  The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook by Beth Hensperger, Rustic European Breads for Your Bread Machine by Eckhardt and Butts,  and Pizza, Focaccia, Flat, and Filled Breads from  your Bread Machine by Lora Brody.I'd also recommend using King Arthur flours (especially the White Whole Wheat flour).Buy a Breadman Ultimate and have fun!\n",

However, I've recently found an uncannily sharp little knife (at an Asian store) that makes it so I don't need to whip this out as often (for non-French fry things). It does take a little time to clean (much more than my knife), but other than that, I love this product.It doesn't fit huge potatoes, but it fits most of them I have.

      "This is one of the few TV-advertised bits of cookware that actually lives up to its reputation. It does burgers exceptionally well- I like the way it drains off excessive moisture- often a problem with hamburger meat- instead of allowing the burger to boil in it. It's especially useful for singles and students who like to buy bags of frozen patties for quick meals.You can also do a bit of creative cooking with it, like grilling sliced vegetables brushed with olive oil and spices- try eggplants and meaty tomatoes. Marinated chicken breasts. How about shrimp? Yes, it works. Marinate shrimp in olive oil, parsely, breadcrumbs, parmesan, garlic, salt and pepper, toss them on the grill, close it and wait about a minute.It's great for kids, too. You can let kids who are too young to work over an open flame or a hot burner cook thier own lunches oin the Forman grill with a lot less worry.A surprisingly useful tool for the money.\n",

      "I own many Oxo products, but if you are a new customer to Oxo, I would highly recommend that you start with a product such as this-- Stainless Steel Measuring Cups, because whether you are new to cooking or a seasoned cook, staples like measuring cups belong in every kitchen, because you will find that you will need to rely on them frequently, especially if you are a baker.Not only measuring cups, but measuring cups like Oxo's Stainless Steel Measuring Cups, because they are a heavier weight, not flimsy at all, so that they should stand up to years of use, plus the fact that you do have the option to keep them all together on the included ring.These measuring cups have a sloped design, and do sit flat on your kitchen counter.  I had no problem using them in either round or square containers.If I could make an improvement it would be to make the handles a little longer, so if you need to go deeper into a container it would be easier to get the measuring cup back out.  The handles on these measuring cups, like all Oxo products are very comfortable in your hand, which I love since I do have some dexterity issues.The other thing I might improve on these measuring cups is that yes, you can clearly see what each measuring cup can hold, but I think I would have made the numbers a tad more raised.  I do hope that over time that the measurements are still clearly visible.There are no measurements inside each cup tho.\n",

      "As another reviewer mentioned, there are 2 models that appear identical but with different amps. Mine is the 12 amp 3670 & it is a little powerhouse. After using it for several years, I've finally decided to write up a review. What I wanted was a powerful little canister vac and indeed, this little unit is just that. I see why folks use it as a mini-shop vac. However, here's where I have found it to be problematic for petite me: the long cord. Initially a good idea but in actuality the length is a nuisance. I finally wrapped up what I don't use & tied it up with a velcro strap -- I'd rather unplug a cord a couple of times instead of picking up the durn cord, sidestepping the durn cord & tripping over the ding dang durn cord. The hose: it's unwieldy & is ALIVE! What I mean is, I try to coil the hose & tuck it away &... it just pops out...after me. The hose also kinks easily & I find myself constantly wrestling with it. While the exercise is good, I wish it were more flexible so I could easily coil it around the machine for storage. I use a box to stuff the durn thing in it, to contain it in the closet..& yet it still sets itself free. The brush attachment is useless at best. I use brushes from my former vacs that croaked after years of use. Would I buy this vac again? Probably not. These days, it's regulated to the upstairs bathrooms & dryer vents. I use an upright vac for the carpets. Downstairs there are no carpets & I use \"the critter\". \"The critter\" was a gift to me, is 6 months old & I'm quite fond of it. It's a Eureka Rally 2 at 11amps. It has a retractable cord: YAY! It's not too long: YAY! The hose is quite flexible & stays put when I wind it around \"the critter\": YAY again! I've nicknamed it \"the critter\" because it easily follows me around like my 2 cattledogs. It's lightweight, doesn't trip me up, the METAL wand attachment has this nifty latch that extends it from short to long. It has a small bag & yes, I'll have to change it frequently what with 2 cattledogs, but for me it's the perfect little vac. Note: it is shy on attachments which isn't an issue for me since I've saved my old attachments. For now, I'll keep the Boss 3670 only because it is a workhorse. But, I am using it less & less with \"the critter\" around.\n",

The handles have a notched hole for hanging, and they come on a small ring to demonstrate this. The size of each measure is imprinted in the handle material in a contrasting color (sort of orange), and should last reasonably well.There are no fill lines or other markings or designations, but for measuring non-liquid items, they would be easy to scrape across the top to get a level measure, unlike glass measuring cups.I don't do a lot of baking these days, but I would think these would be outstanding for measuring dry ingredients.They are easy to hold and very sturdy.

Melitta as a manufacturer has always been about coffee, so when this product came up in my gold box offering, I took the plunge.  The coffee maker is excellent, it has plenty of grind adjustments and hold more than enough beans to make a strong pot of coffee if that's what you desire.  It is not difficult to clean or assemble. The only change I'd make is a slight one.  The coffee brews into the pot through the lid, the lid has ridges but could be difficult for someone with arthritis or an elderly individual who's grip is not too strong.  A slight adjustment by the manufacturer could easily correct this and there are plenty of ways to remedy that slight oversight.  It's certainly not enough to rate this product less than 5 stars.

The Sifter has no troublesome awkward levers to pull or cold steel handles to squeeze instead, it features a comfortable handle that fits perfectly in your hand. With a slight shake side to side, the sifting mechanism is activated and with little effort you have perfectly sifted flour.  These were the main features that I was looking for in a flour sifter.  Something that you just shook and the flour would be sifted, after-all I'm not looking at the performance of a sports car, this is just a flour sifter. Something that doesn't take up much room, but is efficient in its use with little effort. The top and bottom lids keep flour fresh and the inside of your cupboards clean. The OXO Good Grips Sifter is so much easier to use that you will look forward to those recipes that call for sifted ingredients. Simply shake side to side for sifted flour or powdered sugar Comfortable, ergonomic handle Top and bottom lids keep sifter and cupboards clean, Dishwasher safe.Some of the products features are:* Wide, comfortable, ergonomic handle* Sifter shakes side to side with one-handed operation* Cup and gram measurements listed* Lids seal the top and bottom* Stainless-steel construction* Dimensions: 4.5 IN x 4.63 IN x 6.5 IN* Weight: 8 oz.The covers are used when measuring and sifting, not primarily for storage, the top is not air-tight. Why would you ever store a sifter with any flour in it anyway, you are just asking for problems. Just tap it out completely into the trash or sink to remove excess flour.The top cover is specifically designed to stay on during sifting, keeping flour/cocoa etc. from wafting out while you shake-shake-shake. The bottom cap keeps contents from falling through the mesh screen while you measure flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, etc. into the top. That way, you can move it around your workspace if you need to. If you forgot that pinch of nutmeg that's supposed to be sifted-in with the baking powder and flour, just walk the sifter over to the pantry and shake-in the spice or whatever is needed at the time.  The mess is almost eliminated and you'll enjoy a better baking experience.Think of this sifter as a baker's tool and less as a sifter. This product is great at working with dusting's. If you ever just wanted to do a light powdered sugar coating on something this may be the tool for your because the sift is slow. The second good use is for putting flour down on the counter top to kneed bread. It sifts over a large area so it is quick at making a light dust over a large area. But don't forget that this sifter has a capacity for larger amounts of flour as well. So, you get flexibility, versatility, and convenience, not bad for a flour sifter.I still am sold on the shake and sift mechanism, for the above reasons, and it can be done one handed and you can control the amount of flour sifted easier and it doesn't need to be an all at once speed sift.  I get better results when I take my time baking, after-all, I'm baking and I'm not running the 100 yard dash.  That's what I tell my grandkids when they are over and we make/bake something they enjoy to eat. After a few years of use this sifter is still doing it's intended job and many baked goods later the grandkids still enjoy coming over and learning some new baking skills.\n",

I was happy enough until the measurement stamps on them started to wear off. I don't keep my cups in a set, but separated in case I need to other things with them or leave them in, say, coffee. These are on a ring, but with the handle design it lets you pull them off easily and also put them back on the ring with no fuss.These are thick stainless steel and can be used to warm small amounts of things like butter, or dissolve Monk fruit granules in vinegar for sushi on the stove. I like the super grip handles. The toughest thing my set will ever have to scoop will be rice. The handles didn't bend at all. I can see where they could, but I don't see the point in torturing a good set of measuring cups. (They aren't really scoops, after all. That's a different design altogether.)I love them!

      "I have owned two of these trays for about a year and I'm about to buy two more--but why would I do that for a 3-star product? Simply put, they aren't perfect but they're the best of what's out there.What sets these trays apart from others is the lid, which I've learned to both love and hate. I love the lid for one reason: in a frost-free freezer, it prevents ice cubes from evaporating over time. If you use your ice often, that isn't a problem, so I'd say the benefit of the lid to you is not worth the hassle. (More about that in a moment.) But if you're like me, and use ice infrequently, you'll no longer have the experience of reaching for a tray (usually when guests ask for ice) only to find that your cubes have mostly evaporated. Now I always have ice when I need it, even a couple of months after I've filled the tray. I'd say the lids also make for easier stacking.And that, for me, makes it worth putting up with the negatives of this product mentioned in other reviews:1) The lid is a pain to slide on and off--not a big deal after the cubes are frozen, but it can be a real mess-maker when you're filling trays. I now snap the lids on instead of sliding, but I still spill some water no matter how careful I am.2) The cubes are on the smal/medium size, though some may find that to be a benefit.Oxo has been taken to task for poor design on this tray, but I'm not sure that's the case. There just may not be a \"better\" way to put a lid on an ice tray that will protect again evaporation and freezer burn. If you don't see that protection as a benefit to you, then I'd strongly suggest buying a conventional tray. But if you do, then be prepared for the compromises that I and others have mentioned.Thanks for reading my review--I hope it has given you information that will help in your purchase decision!\n",

I am a first-time bread machine owner and was actually astonished that the Breadman does everything that was promised with minimal tweaking. I have discovered, however, that one should be observant during the first kneading operation to make sure that all the dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed into the dough mass. If not, simply add a little water (up to a tablespoon at first), and help the unabsorbed flour etc. into place with GENTLE nudges from a plastic spatula. The machine then does the rest and does it magmificiently. You are now free to go watch television, clean the house, play with computer, nag the spouse, or nap. Because of the necessity for this initial watchfulness, I am very hesitant to try the delayed baking option; also, since many recipes require the inclusion of eggs and other perishable foodstuffs I simply do not think it wise to let the non-cooked ingredients to sit at room temperature for several hours. On the brighter side, I did not find the machine noisy or loud, certainly not as intrusive as the average dishwasher.

      "I have had a J.A. Henckels 3\" Fine Edge paring knife for 6 months.  It was a great knife until a family member decided to stick it in a meat grinder last night.  But we won't hold that against the knife.The handle is comfortable and easy to grip.  With 3 through-rivets it is securely attached.  The handle includes a very good front quillon to keep fingers from sliding onto the blade.  The full length tang aligns perfectly with the handle reflecting quality workmanship even though the knife was made in China.The knife was super sharp when first bought, more like a razor blade than a knife blade.  Even though the blade is stainless steel, it kept the fine edge and never needing to be sharpened nor honed.  To help keep it sharp I never put it in the dishwasher to avoid exposure to the harsh detergent.For many purposes the 3\" length will be perfect.  I think that I prefer a slightly longer blade.  There were many times while slicing vegetables that I cut a thin layer of skin off the tip of a finger holding the item being sliced--not enough to draw blood, but always surprising.  This has never happened to me with any other knife and I attribute these little mishaps to the blade being so short that I did not have as good a visual line on the blade as with a longer blade, and because it is so sharp.Henckels makes many fine knives.  The Fine Edge line of knives is a discount line, and prices are quite modest.  I bought an 8\" Fine Edge chef's knife at the same time and have been very happy with it also.  The main difference between these discounted Fine Edge knives and some of the more expensive Henckels lines, other than price, seems to be cosmetic.  Thanks to the encounter with the meat grinder I now am shopping for a new paring knife.  I would have bought another one of these except it is not available with free super saver shipping, and the total cost with shipping seems a bit high.  I think I will buy a 4\" paring knife in stead, but if you are looking for a 3\" knife and like the price, I think you will like this knife.\n",

      "This tiny vacuum is the best.  I volunteer my time cleaning at a cat rescue.  I run this vac almost two hours straight cleaning cement basement floors, and carpeted cat perches/furniture. The machine can get hot, but it still has a powerful suction to a concrete floor with the vac head attachment. Even with a overly full bag it still has suction and the cord is long.  I just wish the bags were larger though, as they fill up fast with cat hair and litter.  :) I do not suffer from elbow fatique considering how long I am using the machine.  The only issue I had was when a tiny cat toy got caught in the plastic pipe at the connection to the corrigated hose.  This happens quite often and the person who owns the vac fixed it by disconnecting those pieces.  This vacuum can handle being run hard and still works great.  I purchased one for my mother in law because its so easy to use, carry and to change the bags.  I think this Eureka Mighty Mite vac is better then the expensive mini Riccar I own.\n",

This thing is amazing at popping with close to 100% efficiency - that is there are very few unpopped kernels if you do it right. Sometimes I use a bit of cooking oil, a dash of salt, and 2 tablespoons of water. Other times I'll use more oil and some sugar. Other times I'll use coconut oil and a bit of olive oil.

      "I'm a big fan of OXO kitchen utensils and tools.  I have many OXO kitchen utensils in my kitchen that are nearly 13 years old and are still looking new after years of frequent use.  I was excited when I got the opportunity to review these stainless steel Good Grips measuring cups.  They're great quality and I'm sure they're bound to last through years of repeated use.The handles on these measuring cups are rubberized giving you a nice comfortable grip.  I did notice with my set that the handles do seem to attract dust and small particles of baking ingredients.  I'm not thrilled about that, but it's better than having stainless steel handles that aren't as comfortable to hold.This set only has four measuring cups.  You'll get cups in the following measurements with this set: 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup.  If this set had 1/8 and 3/4 cups I would have given this product five stars.  Many of the recipes I use call for ingredients of either 3/4 or 1/8 of a cup.  I'd much prefer to have to clean one cup to measure out 3/4 vs. using two or having to scoop out the ingredients three times.  It's a pain to have to pack brown sugar into a 1/4 cup three times when a 3/4 cup could have taken care of the job in one shot.  Because the set is missing those two cups that I use on a regular basis, my cheap plastic measuring cups that are 13 years old won't be going anywhere.I do like that you don't have to take all of the measuring cups off the ring to get to the size that you need to use.  My plastic measuring cups are like that and I find it to be a pain in the rear to have to pull half of the cups off to get the one that I need.  The OXO cups eliminate that problem.  You simply pop the cup off the ring and you're good to go.Overall, I think these measuring cups are decent.  For the price I wish they had 3/4 and 1/8 cups, too.  It is a decent quality product that will see you through years of use.\n",

      "I didn't grow up in a family with a pressure cooker (PC), so really the only thing I knew or thought I knew was that they were dangerous, hard to use, something from the past. Boy could I not have been more wrong. I started thinking of getting one probably for the same reasons you are, the appeal of fast cooking, with tasty and healthy results, and improved safety over the pressure cookers from the past. My wife and I have had this model now for a couple of weeks and it delivers on all counts.The basic idea is that because of the pressure that builds up inside, water gets to 250 degrees, it is super hot. And at that temperature it can break down the tough parts of meats and cook things very quickly. Yet it also retains nutrients and tastes good. Well it does cook fast and it is tasty. I will take the experts opinion that it is also a healthy way to cook.As a PC newbee I had no idea what to expect. First off is a little bit of assembly. That went quickly and smoothly. Second is READING the instruction booklet. This is not a pan or a microwave or something like that. It is safe..but also something that is, well, under pressure. And pressure can be dangerous. After getting familiar with the parts of the pressure cooker we cooked our first meal, a pot roast. It was super easy and delicious. We used, frankly, a pretty cheap piece of meat but it came out tasting fantastic. It was quick but something to keep in mind is cooking time does not usually include the time to heat it up and the time to cool it down. Also you can't just walk away. Once the pressure seals the cooker most of the time you have to then reduce the heat. But it really isn't that much oversight.In any event even taking all of that into account it was still by far the fastest pot roast I have ever cooked and better than average in taste. We have done some chicken dishes and some rice dishes. It has turned out perfect rice in a fraction of the time it would have taken otherwise. We are still getting a feel for seasoning. Sometimes we have had dishes too seasoned and other times not but nothing that hasn't been easily as tasty as other ways we cook things.So if you are a PC newbee like me I say give it a try. As long as you read the instructions and respect the pressure it is a pretty easy way to cook with excellent tasty results in a quick amount of time. Granted it has only been a couple of weeks but we have eaten out much less these 2 weeks. We picked up a well regarded cookbook on AmazonPressure Perfect: Two Hour Taste in Twenty Minutes Using Your Pressure Cookerand so far so good. This could easily become the main way you cook, it has that a good a combination of benefits and realtive ease of use. What it excels at is...great results/unit of effort and time. I can't see many other ways that you can maximize your cooking effort and cooking time than a PC.\n",

      "I only recently learned how to shuck oysters and is something I had never done before.I both read about shucking and also had the guy who sold me some oysters explain how to do it.With a little bit of practice, I got it down, and now can open any oyster in no time at all!What you want to do is the following:-Find the point of the oyster that looks like a V-Keep the oyster with the 'cup' (the non flat side) down so that when you open it, the juice from the oyster won't fall out-Initially, you may want to hold the oyster down with a kitchen towel so that it doesn't slip (I initially did this, though after some practice, just hold the oyster with a gloved hand)-Insert the tip of the blade (with the very tip facing upwards) into the V and wiggle it with some force from side to side (but keeping it flat).- After the blade has been inserted 1/4 - 1/3 of an inch, try to pry it open by turning the blade. If you feel some resistance, push through and the oyster will open, but if it doesn't give, don't push through or you will crack the shell, making it opening it so much harder (I find this is the thing that takes the most practice - knowing when to continue to turn the knife to pry the thing open without cracking the shell... so you'll get this with some practice)- After it has opened, insert the blade in all the way with the tip of the knife along the inside of the top half of the shell and cut all around to cut the muscle that is holding it closed- After you remove the top shell, carefully cut the muscle that is holding the bottom shell to the oyster. Also go all around the oyster with the knife as the bottom tends to stick to the shell, and make sure it is free floating- You're done! Add some lemon and tabasco, and voila! Enjoy!I have to say, I have no experience with other knives, but this knife has worked wonders, it has a comfortable grip, the steel is sturdy enough to get past some strong oysters I have encountered, and the slightly upwards bend of the tip makes it easy to cut away at the muscle on the top of the oyster. All in all, perfect! Highly recommended.\n",

      "This blender arrived on Friday the 11th, and is being returned on Monday, the 14th.My first suspicion came as I unpacked the blender and I noticed the base was not chrome, but in fact, plastic.  (which was not disclosed on the technical information).  The cord was thin, and only had two prongs at the end, in comparison with my old Waring blender with a very thick black cord and  3 prongs at the end for heavy duty performance.My enthusiam dampened, I put an inch of freshly peeled and thinly sliced ginger in the blender, went first topuree, then to liquify, then with no decent results went through all of the  different selections and barely got useable results.  I then put in a half of bunch of parsely, (unchopped)  read the instruction booklet, tried the selections for different speeds, and end up with chopped parsley flakes everywhere.  Unwilling to give up in spite of failed attempts, I added my berries, and applesauce. Berries, sweet, soft berries, and soft applesauce. I pureed, I liquidfied, I went through all the speeds, and ended up with bits of berries, ginger, and tons of parsely flakes everywhere and produced the worst unblended drink in my blending career.  Perhaps most people don't blend fresh ginger and parsely (so-o good for you and tasty too), but my old waring blender has been making this drink for me for years, giving me smooth pureed results each time.Hindsight being better than foresight, I realized I allowed myself to be seduced with the very nice new shape of the blender jar, thinking it would work much better than the old shape, and the new \"touch pads\" .  Wrong on both counts.  The wide shortened new shape looks great, but somehow doesn't work as well as the narrow original shape of the blending jars.  The touch pads are a pain to use, and you have to be in the right light to see if you've turned the machine on or if it's off.  I was very disappointed in the blender, but more in Cusinart, a brand I have trusted for years who makes the best food processor imaginable.  So much for trusted brands. I'm refurbishing my Waring blender with new parts, at least I know it works well.\n",

      "I picked this up at the start of summer. i've made quite a few batches of ice cream. My favorites come from the Ben & Jerry cook book. There are a lot of benefits from making your own ice cream. it's cheaper. It's rewarding. It's healthier too. Even if you make the most decadent ice creams, you're still using all natural ingredients with no preservatives.There are some tricks to this machine that greatly help performance.#1 Make sure the bowl is frozen. Leave it overnight. Shake it and if anything sloshes, it's not ready.#2 Chill all ingredients. Even if the ingredients just came from the fridge, put the batter back in. I test my batter to make sure it's 35-38 degrees before starting. This will make the freezing process more gradual, which means the ice crystals will be smaller. Small crystals mean a smoother texture.#3 I let the machine work until there's little or no movement in the ice cream. This depends on how much you've got in the machine, but my recipes make the ice cream expand up above the lip of the container. When ice cream forms over the paddle and doesn't get folded back in, that's when I turn it off.#4 Let it firm up in the freezer for 4-6 hours. IT WILL BE SOFT, maybe even runny, out of the machine. I try to avoid runny, so next time either let the machine run longer or your kitchen may be too warm. Why is runny bad?  Runny is liquid and you want to try and keep air in the ice cream, so the firmer it is going in, the better. Get it in the freezer fast. Also resist the urge to pack the ice cream down, with either a utensil or by dropping it on the counter. A smooth surface may look nice, but you want to keep air in the ice cream. The air is what makes it easy to scoop and gives it a good texture.#5 Put the bowl in a plastic bag while in freezer. This keep the frost out and improves taste. Make sure it's completely dry before going back in the freezer.#6 I'd also recommend going all out and using rich cream batters. These have the least water and will have the best texture. I'd prefer one scoop of really good ice cream to 4 of a crappy sorbet.#7 Add solid stuff near the end. Wait until the last 1/2 of freezing to add your berries, chips, etc. This will help to evenly distribute stuff throughout the mixture. I like to make strawberry, so I mash my berries, drizzle in the juice, then put the mush in during the last 1/2 of the cycle.#8 Store ice cream in an air tight container with plastic wrap pushed down to the surface. I use 1.5 quart Rubbermade  containers. They fit perfectly and allow the least amount of freezer air to touch the ice cream. Fat easily obsorbs oders and can make your ice cream taste funky. You could just keep it in the bowl, but I wouldn't do that unless you plan to eat it all later that day. Plus, the sooner you get the bowl clean and back in the freezer, the sooner you can make more ice cream!I've used a GE model that had two speeds. The slower speed seemed to freeze better. I also know of some machines that have a reverse function. I would be interested in checking these out if this one ever dies.Mine came with an extra bowl, which is nice to have one always frozen.In all, a great purchase and a pretty good price. Haven't bought ice cream from the store since.\n",

Another excellent feature is a built in garnishing  tool that allows you to cut designs into citrus fruit thus giving you two  kitchen gadgets for the price of one.

      "When I first heard about a zester, I was intrigued. I promptly went out and bought one to remove lemon peel for Lemon Meringue Pie. I decided that a zester had to be the best thing since the invention of the whisk.A \"zester\" allows you to create fine strips of peel from lemons, oranges and other citrus fruits. It is essential for all cooks if you want to remove lemon peel for a Lemon Meringue Pie or for orange peel if you are making Orange Butter.To remove zest from citrus, simply pull the sharp edge of the zester across the fruit peel. The zester has fine holes which are sharp and cut into the peel. This results in fine strips of citrus peel which may then be chopped. If you want to obtain small pieces without having to chop the zest, just pull the sharp edge across a small section at a time. I recommend using organic citrus fruits.If you want to make a pretty display of oranges and lemons, you can use the \"channel knife\" to cut thin strips of peel out of the citrus fruits. The result is a decorative pattern. I start at the top of the citrus fruit and wind my way around to the base. Think of how you peel an apple and it is just as easy.Just a hint: Try to only obtain the yellow layer in lemons, the orange layer in oranges, etc. The white pith is very bitter.~The Rebecca ReviewP.S.

The spoons bend easily, even alarmingly much-- no using them to scoop equal measures of cookie dough.For sturdiness and longevity, I actually prefer Oxo'smetal spoonswhich feel solid and durable, but cost more per-spoon.Recommended, for plastic spoons, but metal ones preferred.\n",

      "This is a pretty decent electric popper that heats up fairly quickly and is reasonably easy to clean.  The spin arm detaches from the heating tray and lets you clean the base with reasonable convenience while the bucket itself is a sturdy plastic that can hold quite a bit of popcorn.  The butter tray on top however I find is largely useless, if you use it to dispense butter onto your popcorn as its popping more gets left behind than makes it through the holes provided and then if you're not careful later on, that lid can come off and you wind up with a mess in your lap.  With ordinary grocery store, common grade popcorn it does a pretty good job of popping them with around a 90% pop ratio, though a bit of care has to be given to how much oil you use, too much and less kernels wind up popping, not enough and the popped corn tastes a bit dry and styro-foamy, I found the suggested oil measurements a tad bit on the low side but a good base to tweak off of based upon one's personal preferences.What I was disappointed with however was when I used higher quality kernels that have a much better taste profile that this popper doesn't pop them nearly as well.  I imagine it has to do with how much heat the heating surface produces because when I make the gourmet kernels in my stovetop, they all pop except for a tiny few stubborn kernels.  With this popper I'm lucky to get a 50% popping ratio with my gourmet kernels, and as such this wound up seeing progressively less use.  Its good for what its intended for, making cheap popcorn with a minimum of fuss, but for the kind of popcorn I like I found its performance fell short of my wants.\n",

We lost a part on our first during a move, tried a couple alternate brands, and ended up buying another Cuisinart as the other brands just didn't work as well for us.We found that the bowl on this brand seems to freeze more solid, thus making thicker ice cream despite the ambient temperature of the room. The others we used would barely hit super soft serve on hot days, whereas this will get to super thick soft serve.Additionally, it just seems to be more sturdy and the motor isn't quite as loud as the others we'd tried (but it's not whisper soft by any means)In addition, we're dairy free, so have to make non-animal milk ice creams.

      "It makes me upset when hearing people complain that a pricey Henckels is not as sharp as a $3.5 knife! It doesn't matter how much you paid for a knife, it needs to be sharpened! The difference between a good and a bad knife is the degree of sharpness it can hold and the duration it will last. A good knife should never be serrated so it can be sharped. A knife of $3.5 will never be as sharp due to the material used.My guess is that some people are comparing a over-used, never sharpened Henckels with a newly bought $3.5 knife. The edge of a knife is a singular point and the sharpness is only determined by the way it is sharpened and the steel composition. A cheap knife after sharpening will go dull quickly and settle to a stable sharpness (much less shaper than a higher end knife). That's why you will see knifes have difficulties cutting through tomato and pork skins. A good knife with well maintained edge can last at least for a few weeks and even that is far better than a newly sharpened cheap knife. A few strokes of sharpening will restore its full luster in no time.A over-used Henckels can be just as bad as a cheap knife unless being taken care of. Whoever thinks an expensive Henckels doesn't need sharpening deserves the suffering and frustration of using a $3.5 knife when cutting through onions, tomatoes and chicken skins.\n",

Yet the chicken was very crispy and very juicy.

Less than 2 minutes with a metal file broke these hard edges nicely.Overall, a great tool for the price. I've ordered 2 already. I'm looking forward to wielding these for the next decade or so.\n",

      "I first saw this cake pan a couple of years ago - it wasn't available at Amazon and the price and shipping was more than I wanted to spend. I continued to search Amazon every so often until they had it. I bought it immediately and have now used it a number of times. As other reviewers have said - the quality is superb, the finish excellent, and the design is quite eyecatching. Cakes release easily with just a misting of spray, clean up is easy. The design is crisp and clean. Glazing it does present a bit of a problem, as the deep pattern forms a trough which funnels glaze right down to the plate. Just glaze it on a cooling rack set in a cookie sheet and you won't have the mess on the plate or counter. Scrape up the glaze from the cookie sheet (might have to heat it briefly to get it to flow again) and continue to glaze until it looks how you want it to look. This pan is not as large as the commercial version, so it might not hold all of a large recipe. Don't fill beyond about 1.5 inches below the top, or you might have a mess in the oven (uh, I know this how?  Yep, I did it.) Any excess batter can be baked in a small loaf pan or small cake pan.BTW, bakers. Please encourage Amazon to bring back the 4 for 3 promotion in baking pans. It was a wonderful way to fill the cupboard with beautiful pans at a reasonable price and I miss that promotion greatly.\n",

      "Overall I like this popper. No real mess and popcorn in less than ten minutes with virtually every kernel popped without having to stand over it and shake the pot like you do on a stove.The only negatives I have are:1) that it doesn't automatically turn off when done as advertised so you have to keep an eye on it if you don't want your popcorn to burn.2) the method of applying butter is not very good. You place chunks of butter into the top of the dome and the heat from the popping melts it, dripping the butter evenly onto the popcorn as it is stirred by the stirring arms. The problem is that some of the holes are indented and some are raised. If you mistakenly place the chunks onto the raised vents, the butter doesn't drop onto the popcorn because it takes too long to melt and flow over to the indeted vents. The vents meant for dripping the butter should be divided from those meant srictly for vening the steam generated by popping the corn. This way you don't accidentally block too many of the vents, which would cause the popcorn to become soggy.These are the reasons I only gave it 3 stars instead of 5. Fix these two problems and it is definately a 5 star product. I still love it a lot more than manually popping over a stove in a pot. The popcorn comes out a whole lot less greasy and 99.9% of the kernels pop unstead of about 90% the old fashinoned way.\n",

It may be called a &quot;jelly roll&quot; pan, but I can bake upwards of a dozen cookies on it and rarely burn one.  With the old nonstick sheets (of which I tried and discarded several brands over the years)the burn rate was more like 25-50%.  Other uses for this sheet are under other open dishes, like casseroles and pies, for catching the drips and runovers -- the raised sides make this possible.Using a sheet of parchment paper or a silicone mat, cleanup is a snap.  Once in a while it doesn't hurt to handwash to remove accumulated residue on the edges, but it takes a lot of baking before that becomes an issue.This pan will occasionally warp at the higher temperatures, but always snaps back as it cools down.  I don't think I've come across a baking sheet yet that hasn't done that at one time or another, so it probably just comes with the territory.It looks like I am done with forever replacing my scratched cookie sheets!\n",

      "I am an avid shopper of Amazon, however I bought this fan in a store, because I asked the clerk to open it up and plug it in so I could test it in the store before I came home with it.I have over the past few years bought so many other useless fans, lots of noise and no air movement. The blades were wrong or the motor was a piece of dog poop.This fan is near perfect!  The three speeds are great. The motor noise is NORMAL given the amount of air this thing can move. I use mine mostly outside on the patio because I love the outdoors even on a hot day. This fan keeps me and my company super cool.I often set the fan up on a side table so is is blowing on our upper bodies rather than just our legs.We had a heat wave recently and my air conditioner in my motorhome was struggling inside, so I brought the fan inside from the patio.  It really helped cool the motorhome and keep the air conditioner from freaking out.The price is right, the fan really works, really cools. The noise is normal given the nice gale force wind you can get out of this on the high setting.My only complaint to the manufacturer is that the legs that are supposed to keep it from tipping over are ridiculous. First they need 2 on each side, not just 2 on one side. They are very small and super flimsy. Four legs about an inch or two longer would have been a huge bonus. If the fan is off and you accidentally bump it just the least little bit, BANG, it falls right over on the side that has no anti-tip legs.The fan is very light and easy to store when not in use.

This kit removes actual metal from your knife every time you use it.  It did make my knives sharp, but the benefit never lasted more than one or two uses.  This lead me to do more research and learn about the important practice of honing your knife to keep the edge straight.I bought this honing steel and it made a dramatic improvement in the cutting ability of my knives.  I now understand that I should sharpen my knives once or twice a year but I should hone them every time I use them.  Honing doesn't remove any metal, so it won't wear out the blade.In my testing, 5 passes along each side of the blade (10 total swipes) is enough to make my Pro S Chef's knife cut like it is brand new every time.This particular steel has a very high quality feel and it also is very long so my long chef's knife doesn't run out of runway.I wish I had learned about this a long time ago!\n",

      "I have never spent more than maybe $10 on a fan in my life, so I was kinda antsy about buying this one, but seriously, it was absolutely worth the price for me.Let me explain my situation: My building is really old, retains a LOT of heat, and the wiring is such that tenants are only allowed to have one small window AC unit per apartment. Moving it back and forth from one side to the other is a huge pain, but it results in a sort of less-dramatic Sophie's Choice: do we leave the AC in the bedroom so we can actually sleep, or leave it in the living room/kitchen so that we can actually get things done without dying of heatstroke? So that's why I bought this fan--to help move air in the kitchen/living area and hopefully make both rooms habitable during the heat. I haven't gotten the chance to test it during a major heat wave yet (hopefully I won't NEED to *crosses fingers*) but so far, I could not be more pleased with how well it works.What I love the most about it is the versatility. It is nearly silent on the \"low\" settings, but when you set it on \"high,\" it moves a LOT of air. The fact that you can flip back and forth between intake and exhaust is really one of the selling points--it's super-handy in our combined kitchen/living room because, when my partner is cooking, we can flip it on to draw out a lot of the heat it produces. If we open up all the rooms, it helps a lot with cross-ventilation--way more than the box fan we were using previously. In addition, our old building has huge radiators which produce a TON of heat in the winter, and the exhaust function, when placed in a window near the radiator, helps a lot with keeping it from becoming too hot in here. Bonus! Basically, it does everything I hoped it would do, and a couple of things I didn't even anticipate.I also love the way it's shaped--it fits nicely in the windowframe, and has a cute retro appeal. It's front-heavy, but still quite easy to move. It's also easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning, which is a HUGE plus.My only complaints, all of which are extremely minor:-I wish it were a little flatter, just because now we can't really close the indoor shutters on that window, but that's an unusual situation (most people probably don't have those!) and I won't fault the design for it.-I'm a little concerned about the switch--it seems a bit flimsy and I'm afraid it'll break if I turn it with too much enthusiasm. But, so far, so good!-while it's pretty quiet, it does make a distinctive noise on the exhaust setting. It's a bit annoying, but if you're more than a few feet away, you can't really hear it--I've used it while napping on the couch before and not found it distracting.\n",

      "I'm used to using measuring implements with a bit of weight. Metal, with more metal, held together by metal. These guys are plastic, and chunky as heck. The shape of the measuring cups is such that the flour tends to not stick to the corners of the bottom. You know how when you measure out things like corn starch on a humid day, and the thing tends to stick to the bottom, because of the shape of the measuring device? Because these have a rounded edge, as well as that ovular shape with tapered stuff going on, the flour seems to slip right out. Definite bonus.I don't think that the numbers will stay the colour that they are for very long, as the increment of the size of cup is printed on raised lettering with a coat of paint over it. Because it's raised, it's going to be exposed to the elements more than it would if it were sunken into the handle. That being said, because it is raised, there is no pocket for flour to collect in. This means that if I need to switch from regular baking to gluten free baking, I need only give the cups a quick rinse, and I'm safe. With other measuring cups, who have things pressed into them, there is the concern that flour will collect into those pockets, and not come out completely.In my hands, they feel a bit chunky. I'm not a huge fan of the feel, but I guess that if you had small hands, or other such issues with gripping things, you'd appreciate the feel.They have the increments that bakers use, like 1/3, 1/4, 1/2, but also 3/4, and 2/3. VERY handy, so that you don't need to repeatedly do 3 separate 1/4 cup measurements if you want 3/4 of a cup of something. Very handy. The loop that they attach to can easily be snapped on or off. Handy feature. I don't like the cups lassoed together while I bake. I prefer to unhook them, do my measuring, wash them off, then put them back on the ring for storage.\n",

Making soups and stews are a no brainer, making a modest batch of soup stock in short notice is such a time saver.  take the bones and a few root veggies add water, let the cooker come to a pressure and leave for 45 minutes and you have some decent soup base.  The same lines as stews, get some cheaper cuts of meats and cube it up, add your standard seasoning and a can of beer let it run for 15 odd minutes turn off the heat and let it come down in pressure by itself and you have one awesome tender meal.  yeah, you could make the same thing in a regular pot but when you get the same results in a short time it's a simple answer.  why slave in the kitchen when you can be almost a one pot meal.  plus these meals are awesome in the fall.\n",

      "To begin, I don't like the 110 and am now looking to replace it (probably with the Wicked Edge system).  However, its definitely earned its place in our kitchen and made cutting a far more pleasurable process.Pros: Sharpens well, easy to use.Cons: Pretty much butchers carving knives or anything narrower, scratches any knife with multiple contours (carving knife) as its difficult to keep them at a consistent angle, not the ultimate in edge sharpness, need to follow-up with a steel until the burrs are gone.  The last should be done anyway but on the 110 its a must as the last side done will be left with a burr.I started out like many, a set of high-end German knives and wondering why my old Chicago's cut far better.  Back to the manufacturer for a sharpening.  Still inferior to the Chicago's (now thrown away).  Sent back a while later, still a poor edge (though looked nice).  Then I bought the 110, butchered the look of the edge but the knives cut beautifully, for the first time.If you want an easy to use sharpener that results in a consistently decent cutting edge, the 110 is highly recommended.  It will make the task of cutting a lot more pleasurable.  On the other hand, if you are now using stones, you will not like the 110.  Its pretty crude and its not going to give you the fine edge a stone will provide (assuming you are adept at using it).\n",

When I moved out here to Utah my Sons girlfriend threw away the old slicer that I had. I ordered this one when she moved out and I took over the cooking.  This is one of the most versatile and useful slicers I have ever had. The only drawback I can find is that there aren't quite enough inserts to do what it would be otherwise capable of doing. It slices potatoes, onions and everything I've tried to slice and the neat thing about it is you can put it over a big bowl and not be having to empty a small container all the time. They gripper has long prongs that retract as you get closer to the blade and it holds most foods quite securely keeping your fingers away from the slicing blade. Somebody wrote that the holder was a joke, but if you want a joke get the ones that have the little plastic points sticking out that won't hold anything. I gave it four stars because of the insert problem I mentioned earlier. But as far as slicing and dicing you can do it as fast as you can push a vegetable back and forth. As a longtime cook I highly recommend this product for fast slicing and keeping your fingers out-of-the-way. fredt\n",

      "This review is from: Kuhn Rikon Family Style Pressure Cooker 8 Quart (Kitchen)I grew up with food cooked in the old style pressure cooker in China, but never wanted to use it myself because it didn't look safe - steam hissing out of the valve that looked about to fly into the ceiling at any moment. But recently, a friend of mine in China (who owns both Fissler and WMF Ultra) convinced me that the newer pressure cooker is a totally different game. It makes cooking super fast and food comes out delicious. Tempted, I decided to get one also. The short version is that I got Kuhn Ricon Family Style pressure cooker 8qt. Cooking with it is easy and fast, and food indeed come out extremely good! Below is the long version of the comparison between different makers and different sizes.In terms of the maker, the top 3 contenders are: Fissler, WMF and Kuhn Rikon. WMF only sells their entry level model (\"Perfect Plus\") in the US and it is getting mixed reviews. The improved model (\"Perfect Ultra\") is better and more durable but not available in the US. Fissler seems to have similar issues as WMF \"Perfect Plus\": its plastic handle is prone to cracking. So I decided to go with Kuhn Rikon (KR) which is all steel and old style mechanics, but really durable and foolproof with 5 different safety features.Once I decided on the maker, choosing the right size was another challenge. The measurements on KR's website are a bit confusing and incomplete. After talking to the customer service, I got the following dimensions:stockpot 6qt: 8.75\" (&#981;), 7\" (h), 8 lb.stockpot 8qt: 8.75\" (&#981;), 9\" (h), 8.5 lb.family style 8qt: 11\" (&#981;), 6\" (h), 12 lb.Note: Add 2.5\" to the height with the lid on. Actual capacity is 2/3 as you can only fill the pot up to its 2/3.After getting KR Stockpot 8qt initially and then exchanged it with a Family Style 8qt, I come to the following conclusions:* Stockpot 6qt: ideal for small family and small serving sizes, but too small to make 6 servings or large batch of stocks.* Stockpot 8qt: 2\" taller than and same diameter as the 6qt. The shape is not practical -- very tall and narrow -- other than having an extra 2qt capacity for making stock, you can't do much more than what you can with a 6qt pot.* Family Style 8qt: It is much heavier with a thicker rubber ring and a much larger cooking surface. I find it to be the most versatile for making different foods with different methods (steaming whole fish, whole vegi, making stocks, browning large cut of meat, etc.), and great for double-deck cooking (cooking something in the pot and steaming something on the rack). Downside: not ideal for making small serving sizes. A cup of water just covers the bottom. My way to get around it so far is to steam the smaller serving such as a cup of rice in a bowl instead of cooking it in the water.If I could have two pc, I'd get 1 6qt stockpot and 1 8qt family style pot. But if I can only have one pc, I prefer the family style pot for its flexibility.The pressure cooker is very easy to use:* bring the content to boil, the valve on the lid starts to rise, pressure starts to build up in the pc.* To adjust the pressure: the valve has 2 red rings, ring I - lower pressure, ring II - higher pressure. Once the pressure reaches the desired level, turn the heat down to maintain the pressure level (about 2-3 on my induction cook top). When the valve rises to 2.5 rings level, the valve will automatically let the steam out with a hissing sound.* To close the lid: unlike other pc, KR has short handles which are great for storage. Initially, I was concerned about whether it could be opened and closed easily. Once I used it, my worries went away. There is an arrow on the lid. Position the lid so that the arrow points to the handle, twist, it closes.* To de-pressure: 3 modes: 1) fast: less than 30 sec. by rinsing the rim of the lid with cold running water; 2) normal: about 1 min. by pressing the valve with a spoon; 3) slow: about 10 min. by letting it cool down naturally. The above time is based on steaming with very little water in the pc. If you have a lot of liquid food in the pc, it will take a bit longer.A useful accessory for steaming or double-deck cooking: WMF trivetThe rack that is included in the KR pc only stands to 1/4\" tall. WMF trivet is about 2\" tall. With the KR rack on the WMF trivet, food is away from the water and double rack cooking is possible.\n",

      "I'm on my third or fourth one of these, can't remember. Why so many? Because the wimpy plastic parts tend to break here & there or you mess up the mesh filter or ultimately the carafe breaks. Sure, this can happen with any maker that has to employ clever methods to deliver fresh-ground beans and water into an instant-drip mechanism, but if Melitta wanted to, they could have re-designed its weakest parts by now.It'd also cost upwards of what a Capresso maker does, so rather than opt for something more bulletproof, I've chosen to replace broken Mill & Brews when they couldn't be mended and now use the stainless steel model to avoid the inevitable destruction of the glass carafe.If you use good quality, freshly-roasted beans in this thing and utterly-filtered H20, you can produce an outstanding pot of coffee. Since it has no water filter whatsoever, you're responsible for that part as well as the occasional run-through with a weak vinegar/water solution to keep its insides honest.One reason I got the Mill & Brew was its completely programmable timer. But if you're anywhere near the thing when it wakes up and goes to work, you won't need an alarm clock in the house.So like the 665 folks before me, I'll take the \"devil's number\" here and recommend the Mill & Brew as a very good self-starting, self-grinding coffee maker. Just treat it ever so gently when cleaning, handling and re-assembling its plastic parts.\n",

The grind is very fine and the grounds cling to everything - the cup, the spoon, and the lid of the grind catcher - making a mess when I open it up to pour the ground coffee into the coffee maker.  I haven't been able to determine which settings match to the amount of ground coffee that I like to put into the coffee maker and the catcher isn't condusive to scooping the coffee out with a scoop.I guess I don't have enough experience with all the different types of coffee grinders to give this a fair rating, but I don't care for it - it's going back - I gave it one star.\n",

I tried again & again & wound up with farfalle which was still too hard.Next time, I tried boiling the water in the microwave, which took more than fifteen minutes in this cooker.  Then I cooked the spaghetti eight minutes & it had not begun to cook.  So I stirred & put it back four more minutes.  Still far from al dente.  But the water had boiled over into the microwave.Another four minutes & it was a little too hard, but I did not want to risk overcooking.  Also, about a third of the spaghetti slipped through the basket & stuck to the bottom of the cooker.I would not recommend this unless you're willing to put in a lot of time searching for the formula.

      "For a number of years, I've used the Hoover Linx Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner, and it really does have the suction force of some of the larger vacuum cleaners.  However, with 9 cats and 3 dogs, all of whom shed, I found that not only would that vacuum become very clogged with pet hair and other debris, it was very difficult to clean out all of the residue that remained, after vacuuming.  It's now gotten to the point where the machine needs to be taken apart, and professionally cleaned.  I decided to try another type of cordless vacuum, and chose the Eureka Quick Up Cordless, after doing a fair amount of research.  I will say that, for the most part, it works well.  I like the idea of having an extra battery pack.  The suction with this vacuum is adequate for what I need, and pulling excess pet hair out of the brushes, after vacuuming, is much less problematic than with the Hoover Linx.  The cleaning head has a much more open design, and has easy access for cleaning it out.  In my household, there is absolutely no getting around this last step, after I have vacuumed.  For the time being, I think this little vacuum will serve the purpose for my needs.  There is no question, however, that it will never take the place of the larger, more powerful vacuum cleaners.

The handle is very comfortable to hold; very large and chunky, with rubber grips.  The tines are nice and sharp, and a good length.  The weight is good, it feels sturdy.But the problem with it is where the handle joins the stem (if that is the correct word).  This is a 2-part fork, and the main problem is that the stem is quite thin.  I'm not sure how far the stem extends into the handle, but I have noticed it bending during use, and I'm already noticing a bit of rust at the joint, and I'm very worried that one day soon it is just going to break off.  I think when it does break (not if, it is definitely going to break) I will be looking for a sturdier replacement.  I would have given it 3 stars, but it hasn't broken yet so it still gets the benefit of the doubt.

      "After using other stainless steel pressure cookers over the past thirty-plus years, we decided to update our older 6-quart model for this one.  We are extremely happy with this purchase so far.  We've made vegetarian chili (using TVP instead of meat), Pan-in-pot method brown rice, pulled pork (from an 8+ pound shoulder roast) all with great success.  The puled pork was extremely tender and surprisingly delicious.  We also made one of the recipes from the included cookbook (Italian Chicken) and were delighted with the results.Most impressive is how quickly this cooker comes up to pressure and how quickly pressure releases using the natural release method.  One thing we needed to re-learn:  determining when to turn the heat down as the cooker gets to cooking pressure.  The older cooker makes a racket with the jiggler rocking and steam hissing. This one is very quiet and needs to be watched as it comes up to pressure so that it doesn't go beyond its proper cooking pressure.  We really appreciate how quickly this cooker responds to the flame adjustments on the stove.  Overall, we are impressed and sorry we waited so long to make this investment.

      "March 2, 2009: RIPI know this grinder is not in stock and probably discontinued, but cannot resist adding this final note. After eight years of use, my spouse noticed this morning that ground coffee was coming out the ventilation opening on the bottom of the machine. She started shaking the grinder a bit, and more coffee came out. Since it had seemed noisier lately, I decided to take the DeLonghi apart and give it a thorough cleaning.Well...close to a POUND of ground coffee was filling up every empty space in the housing! Tap, brush, and grind produced more and more grounds. It got comical after a while. We had been going through more bean coffee lately, and I should have paid attention to my intuition about that.I reassembled the machine, and sorry to say, almost no coffee was ejected into the grinds cup. It appears that a critical seal failed, and now my DeLonghi is hoarding all the grinds for itself. It may have been so full up that it was producing close to normal levels of grinds -- until I cleaned it.After such a long period of time and over 3,000 pots of coffee, I don't think this grinder owes me anything. Here's hoping I can find a suitable replacement.[[It's worth losing 35 \"helpful\" votes to add a follow-up to my original review: After three years, the only thing that has changed is that the grinds container has cracked. This affects, slightly, how the container fits into the grinder, but does not seem to affect the operation, which is still as described below. I can still recommend this workhorse after over one thousand cycles of use.]]My last coffee grinder was also a burr grinder with an electronic timer -- I got it free as a reject from a tag sale and used it for nearly a year. It ground coffee pretty well but the timer was grossly inaccurate. This DeLonghi seems to have the same general mechanism, but it does a better job with the core task of grinding. The grinder itself is much quieter than my previous machine ... there is hardly any motor sound and the grinding itself sounds almost like a chattering buzz. The manufacturer did a good job of insulating the motor from the housing to reduce noise. The grinds fall into the hopper at room temperature, as they should from a burr grinder. The resulting coffee was darker in tone, and tasted slightly richer for the same amount (by measurement) and approximately the same coarseness as the old machine.I especially liked that the machine comes apart easily -- the top storage hopper screws off and can be washed (the top grinder is attached to the hopper). This also gives easy access to the bottom grinder, which can be brushed clean.The timer is a little hard to set, but seems accurate in comparison with the old machine.This grinder is a bargain. I recommend it whole-heartedly.\n",

It also comes with a nifty plastic blade cover that I use to protect the blade from dulling in my utensil drawer. Nice little feature.\n",

Other than the area turning immediately brown that has been cored, I'm happy.  I'd use this mostly to make apple pies.  So some sugar and baking will hide the browning effect it causes.

      "I have heard for quite some time how wonderful Potato Ricers are. They process the Potato in one squeeze, and prevent over mixing and creating glue when using a stand mixer. I decided to see for myself if I preferred riced potatoes. The first time I used the OXO Ricer, the Potatoes came out creamy and delicious. The texture was different than whipped Potatoes, and the flavor was more &#34;natural&#34;. I didn't need to stir in as much butter or cream as I usually would when I used the stand mixer. I now use the Ricer every time I make Mashed Potatoes, and really enjoy this new method. The OXO Ricer is easy to use, easy to clean, and the padded grips prevent hand cramping if you are processing a larger batch. - Highly recommended.\n",

Since I've had this ricer they have been on the menu much more frequently.

Being a skeptic, I also tested the capacity of these cups, and they are spot on with respect to their accuracy.  Believe it or not, I actually had a set of metal measuring cups a few years ago that were off by a full tablespoon at the 1 cup size.You'll think I work for OXO, but I don't.

      "Back in the 80's and 90's, I had an Italian Il Gelataio ice cream machine that both churned and froze at the same time--as this Lello 4080 does.  It was a battle to clean it and I always had trouble getting the bowl to release so I could remove it to clean.  It was such a pain to clean, that I stopped making ice cream.  Then I tried a Cuisinart ice cream maker where I had to store the bowl in the freezer.  And the huge, cumbersome paddle and the ice cream frozen to the sides and bottom made it very messy to clean.  So, I was afraid to spend the money on this Lello.  How hard would it be to clean a bowl that is part of the machine and can't be removed?Well, I'm posting this review to say that it is amazingly easy to clean.  Do not fear.  So easy to clean that I'm making more ice cream than ever before.  The quality of the stainless steel is wonderful to work with.  The shallower bowl, coupled with the beautiful steel (without seams), coupled with a removable paddle and ice cream that does not freeze against the wall of the bowl makes it very easy to get the ice cream out and clean up the little left in the bowl.  To clean, all you have to do is pour in 1/4 cup of warm water, then take a dry clean dish rag and sop out the residue and water.  Then rinse your rag and wipe again.  Cleaning doesn't even take four minutes.  (Just don't overload the bowl to begin with.  If you overload the bowl, the ice cream will \"grow\" over the sides--and you will have a mess!)We have found that the ice cream created by this machine is far creamier than in any other machine we've had.  I don't know, maybe it is the freezing temperature, maybe the force and speed of the paddle, maybe the way the steel conducts the correct temperature.  But somehow this machine makes a creamy ice cream that beats all others.The recipes provided are very fine-flavored and a great introduction to the types and sizes of deserts that can be accommodated by this machine.  For years my favorite ice cream cookbook has beenBen & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream & Dessert Bookand those recipes work very well with this machine.  (Ben and Jerry's recipes use raw eggs, which is not a problem for us because we raise chickens for eggs, (but you should be aware of that before purchasing their book).  Because this machine produces such creamy results, I'm in search of a great gelato cookbook.It is big and heavy, so before you purchase it, make sure you find the perfect place for it.  You don't want to be trying to lift it down from a shelf above arm-level.  Its feet are very sturdy and do not scratch (unless there is a sandy particle stuck to the bottom of one of the feet), so the machine is easy to slide back and forth.  It is also good to know that the black, heavy-duty cord is very long.I don't care how much this machine cost.  It is worth it, and our family is very happy to have it.\n",

They are lightweight, and I like the roundness of their bowls. The handles have a handy loop to the ends so they can hang on hooks. I keep mine upside down, slipped into the open handle of my big utensil jar, so they are easy to grasp, and since they are upside down they don't accumulate dust or flour.I use them daily - even, sometimes, to remove a little coffee, when I've overpoured a mug and want more room for cream.

      "I have been using the Mini-Prep for a few years.  I like to use it for small jobs like chopping herbs, parmesan cheese, and for making pesto.  I haven't had any problems with processing parmesan cheese as one reviewer did.  The blade has two sides, a blunt side for processing hard items like parmesan cheese, chocolate, and coffee beans and a sharp side for processing soft items such as onions, garlic, meats, and mushrooms.  The sharp side is labeled sharp.  If you alternate between processing hard and soft items, you have to remember to check the position of the blade to make sure you are processing with the right side.  In addition, the processor has two speeds, HI & LO.  The LO speed is recommended for use with the sharp side of the blade and pulse action while the HI speed is recommended for use with the blunt side of the blade and continuous processing.  The Mini-Prep has a lot of kick to it for such a small appliance, and I have found it best to hold it steady with one hand, particularly when processing hard food items, because it will jump when powered on.One thing I noticed, in the instruction and recipe manual under Operating Techniques, the instructions indicate that hard cheese is processed with a blade and position speed of Blunt/HI but the instructions for grated parmesan cheese in the recipe section uses Sharp/HI.  I pulse at BLUNT/HI and then do continuous hold until its grated like I want it.  For best results, cut the cheese into small pieces as indicated in the instruction manual before processing.The Mini-Prep does a fairly decent job of chopping onions and garlic. On occasion I find a stray piece that the blades missed but that's probably because I don't always cut the pieces as recommended.  Overall, I think this is a great little processor and well worth the price.  Just remember to read the instruction manual before you start using it.\n",

      "This mid-priced line of Henckel knives, called &quot;Classic&quot; by the company, is a full-tang, single-piece, three-rivet line with sturdy black plastic handles. The handles are notched at the end to prevent the hand from sliding off during use. Although they are not razor sharp right from the package, their edges are sharp enough for the average cook. According to Henckel, all knives in this line are dishwasher safe, but you should expect more rapid dulling under the harsh conditions.The paring knife has much more weight in the handle than in the blade, making its use feel somewhat awkward. This imbalance results from a relatively long handle which makes it easy to hang onto firmly and therefore more safely than some other brands, especially for those with large hands. Although the paring knife blade is also longer than my Chicago Cutlery paring knife, the change in weight isn't fully offset. Still, I like this knife, and with the other Henckel Classics that I own, it makes a good addition to my cutlery.\n",

I suppose the glass carafe COULD crack, but I'd probably need to take a sledge hammer to it, LOL.It also crushes ice like nobody's business, which was the final deciding factor. A couple other reviews mentioned issues with the button labels peeling off (under warranty, I'd have gotten an immediate replacement - could have missed QC), dripping into the blade housing (no clue how that could happen unless the user held a glass directly over the blade seat) and the motor burning out after \"only\" 2 years (no mention whether the use was extremely heavy, or not). Those really didn't concern me since there were only a few of those. The more predominant reviews were fairly glowing, and those I paid attention to.Mine won't get daily ice crushing duties...only occasional...and I have no plans to try and crush seeds/nuts/cinnamon sticks (that's what my spice grinder and food processor are for), so that doesn't really concern me. The only thing that I would have wished for is a metal motor housing, instead of plastic. I'll just have to be a little extra careful with it. It's the sole reason I took off 1 star, but this is probably normal for modern, small appliances. Unfortunately, almost nothing is made to last, any longer.

I might get back to doing that one day, but right now I just want to get the darned things cooked right before my family starves!The Salton has it all over those little poacher pan inserts in that it's self-timing (measure carefully with the enclosed cup, and when the water boils off, it's done).  Wish I could do more than two at a time, but it's the same compact size that makes this so useful (not cumbersome) in the kitchen.  Soft boiled eggs come out perfect, and I'll note that hard boiled ones seem to peel so much more easily than pan-boiled.  Don't know if that's because of the precise timing or the fact that the eggs &quot;steam&quot; instead of boiling, but it sure makes egg salad less of an ordeal!I notice other buyers have complained of the non-stick bottom bubbling or peeling.

      "I had the OXO can opener with the magnetic lid catcher, and liked it very much, but unfortunately, after a few years, it would grab the can but the big knob would no longer turn. It was not functional anymore. So I purchased this one to replace it. Wow! this guy can open anything! I order canned Blue W. grain-free dog food five cases at a time, and when they're shipped to me, many of them end up dented, even on the top rim. No problem for this heavy-duty opener. The cans I order online have pop-tops, but I like to use the opener because once it has removed the top I can shake out the contents in one piece and then divide it into precise portions. (With a pop-top, you have to dig the contents out with a spoon.) So I am very pleased with this opener.However, I do want to say that when my previous lighter-weight one died, I went to the OXO website and contacted Customer Service via email, and described the problem. They got right back to me and asked me to email them a photo of the broken opener. Even though the flaw was not evident in the photo, they took my word for it that it was not working, and without asking for a receipt for proof of purchase (which was long gone), or even requiring returning the actual opener by mail, they sent me a replacement within 10 days, no charge. The replacement was the other can opener with the magnetic lid catcher, and it works well for almost all cans.But this one is the heavy-duty master.  Thank you, OXO. Awesome products and awesome customer service.Still, thank you, OXO, for your fabulous customer service. Nice to know of a company that stands behind its products.\n",

I returned the 2nd kettle because the lid was so tight I had to have my husband open it or fill it through the spout. (This made cleaning it impossible.)3. The 3rd kettle was returned beacuse it had flaws in the finish and would eventually turn into rust spots.I gave up and expressed my disappointment to Oxo about this kettle, They were kind enough to send one to me. This kettle was great -- at first; but, after awhile, the handle loosened up and, yes, steam began to escape.

      "Reviewed many pressure cookers before deciding on this one.  While it requires a bit of assembly (handles and valve) these are minor issues.  Very well made cooker and the 64 page booklet included useful information and recipes.  Bought the 4 quart model since use for one person most of the time.  Not having used pressure cooker before appreciated the warnings and useful tips on how to use safely.  Like the fact that Presto has replacement seals when needed.  Obviously cooker is useless if do not have this seal and in time am sure will require replacement.  Buying one for my daughter as well who is busy career woman and wants to eat healthy and quickly.  Keeping nutrients and vitamins in the food a plus as is the savings in time cooking a good meal.  Easy to recommend this item.The instruction book that comes with this cooker is probably one of the best I have read in recent years.  At the same time it is also very detailed in the care, maintenance and handling of the cooker.  For example, it recommends replacing the seal and the safety plug once every two years.  Of course that probably depends on the amount of use and the care you take of the product.  In any case recommends replacing the safety plug when you replace the seal.  Both are available on Amazon but this will mean a continuing cost to use the product. At the moment using Amazon Prime cost is about $15 for the pair of items or roughly $7.50 a year if replace every two years. I do highly recommend anyone wanting to use the product to read the instructions very carefully and perhaps highlight the key items.  For example what foods to cook and more important what foods not to cook.  What level in the pot to use for various items depending on their expansion during cooking.  Also you need to look through the hole for the safety plug to be sure it is clear and use pipe cleaners to clean that hole and also the hole through the nut, all explained very clearly in the instructions.  Various tips on how to clean (and how not to clean) the pot are very useful.  If you have induction stove you will need the stainless steel pot since the aluminum pots are not magnetic, but then you probably knew that.Today with so many instructions written in China often they are difficult to read or not very worthwhile.  The instructions with this cooker are quite different. They are important to use the product safely and to get the most value out of the product.  If you are someone who seldom reads instructions or is not willing to spend an hour or so learning about this cooking method or who will not take the time to follow the safety instructions then you probably should consider a different method of cooking.  But an hour or so spent learning about he product will pay off in better cooking, shorter time spent cooking and more healthy eating. I ordered a second cooker for my busy career oriented daughter but then cancelled the order after reading the instructions as I am not sure as busy as she is that she would read and follow them.  I plan to show her mine and see if she will spend the time to learn the system.  If so will order again for her.  Or give her mine and buy second for myself. To me it is worth spending the time to learn about safely using this product but I can see that it is not for everyone.  It is not a pot you just pour water into, stick lid on and fire up the burners.  But once you learn how to take care of it and use it I think you will be extremely pleased with the cooking experience. And the time spent learning and caring for the cooker will pay off in shorter and better cooking.  For those willing to invest a little time, bon appetite!\n",

      "About once a month,  I devote an entire day to making large batches of stews, soups, etc.. in my slower cooker, pressure cook  and on the stove in various large pots.  I then freeze them in smaller packages for future dinners.  These spoons arrived exactly on time for my cooking marathon today and got a good test run.It is hard to say anything new or original about measuring spoons, but here goes.....I tested them against other measuring spoons that I normally use and they appear to be accurate.  I like that the individual spoons snap off of the ring.  That way I don't have to fiddle around with the key ring circular type of holder or a little key chain or use what I need and then have to wash the entire set - not that that is a big deal, but I do like the option of easily separating them.I love that the set contains 1/8 teaspoon and 1/2 Tablespoon measures - very practical and convenient.  I also like the non slip surface.So far the one con and thus only a four star rating, is that the colored measurements on each spoon are small and a little difficult to read, especially on the smaller spoons.I have read numerous reviews which state that the colored measurement wears off rather quickly, even with hand washing. Only time will tell if this will happen to my set, hopefully not, but I will have to deal with that if and when  it happens.The spoons are like all OXO products, study and feel good in my hand.  All things being equal, I am very pleased with these spoons and I look forward to using them frequently.\n",

      "I love coffee and it is extremely important for me to start off the day with a great cup and hence my need for a grind and brew gizmo.I was thrilled at the idea of pouring a couple of spoons of roasted beans and water at night and voila, getting a fresh cup of java in the morning.  Unfortunately, with the Melitta, it was not to be for all I got was a cup of hot brown water.  Now, I am not the smartest guy in the world, but I ain't the dumbest either.  I made &quot;coffee&quot; using this gadget about 15 times, experimenting with a variety of settings and amount of coffee beans and every time all I got was, you guessed it, hot water with varying degrees of brown.  In one case, I even got hot water with a lot of coffee grounds in it.  I cannot figure this machine out.There are some reviewers here who have recommended that the &quot;best&quot; flavor is obtained using two spoons of this and one spoon of that and so on.  I neither have the time nor the patience for such things.  I want to be able to put the beans and water in the thing at night, set the timer on, and wake up to the smell of fresh awesome coffee.  Apparently, the manufacturers had other ideas.Needless to say, I returned the machine and I am back to my using my reliable grinder and coffee-maker.  I suggest you do the same.\n",

      "When I found a recipe for mini-pumpkin cheesecakes, I knew I had to buy some mini-springform pans. The nonstick feature on this set makes them perfect for any recipe. When you receive them, you will think they are the most adorable kitchen item you have ever seen. They are made in Germany and have a 3-year warranty.The pans are easy to close and release as they have a nice large clamp on the sides. This makes them perfect for mini cheesecakes. Molten chocolate cakes also sound delicious. For a party, you might want to order more than one box. These pans fit nicely on a baking sheet and you could bake six to a sheet. You could adapt your recipe so you fill these less and then they would make 1 elegant serving per guest for a party.I was surprised not to find recipes included with the pans, but there are plenty of recipes you could adapt. Just keep the temperature the same and decrease the time. The recipe I have was in the Sunset magazine and called for 10 \"tart\" pans (4 1/2 inch wide with removable rims). The cheesecakes bake at 325 degrees for 20-25 minutes so that might give you an idea of how you can adapt your own recipe.~The Rebecca Review\n",

      "I am a baking fool who lives alone and I love Bundt cake.I'm also a fool for collecting high quality bakeware and now that I have discovered Nordic Ware, I will collect no other.  How thrilled I was to find this Nordic Ware Platinum Collection Bundtlette pan for such a great price recently!  I really didn't need another Bundtlette pan - I already own theWilton Excelle Elite 6-Cup Mini Fluted Panwhich has served me well enough - but this Nordic Ware pan is vastly superior to the Wilton.I'm a vegan who can't have gluten containing ingredients so I also enjoy testing new gluten-free vegan cake recipes. A typical Bundt cake however is too large and way too much for me alone so I prefer making smaller, individual serving cakes I can enjoy by myself, share with my mother - who is my best taste-tester, or freeze for future satisfaction of my wicked sweet tooth.This Nordic Ware 6 bundtlette pan is perfect for my mini-Bundt cake experiments. The presentation is beautifully detailed, requires no additional decoration which tends to add on unnecessary extra calories, and it is the way to go for portion control! Since most Bundt cake recipes are for 10-12 cups, I would suggest buying two of these pans to accommodate your standard recipe and be sure not to fill each cavity more than 3/4 full. Baking time for these mini-Bundts is about 20-25 minutes in a 350 oven.This Bundtlette pan gets a real work-out in my kitchen and for the sake of comparison I have to say that my similar Wilton mini-Bundt pan after several baking projects in a 350 oven has warped slightly and now easily gets dinged, dented and scratched. Wilton bakeware is manufactured in China. Nordic Ware however is made in the USA. Its heavy cast aluminum provides unfailing baking performance. My cakes rise evenly, cook uniformly, are exquisitely detailed, have deliciously golden crusts, and never stick when released from the pan. The pan is made of heavy duty, non-stick walls and clean up is always a snap.  I hand wash with a soft dishcloth after soaking in hot soapy water for about 20 minutes. And Nordic Ware never warps or gets dented and scratched.This is another treasured piece of superior bakeware that will definitely endure the test of time and heavy use. Then I'll pass it down as an heirloom to my baking loved ones when I throw in my apron. Nordic Ware has never let me down and keeps on delighting me with every beautiful piece of bakeware that I add to my collection of specialty baking pans. Made in the USA Nordic Ware has become a name I can always trust never to fail me.\n",

      "I eat a lot of potatoes. I mean a LOT.  We probably go through 10-15 lbs a week.  We tried all sorts of different scrubbing devices to clean all of those potatoes, and every single one either didn't clean well, had flattened bristles within a month, or was just hugely uncomfortable and sometimes painful.  This made cleaning potatoes the biggest dread in the kitchen. So after I stopped being able to make my husband clean every single potato every time, I started looking for a new, fancy potato scrubber that I wouldn't bloody my knuckles using.  Money was no object (within reason, I wasn't going to justify $1000 for a brush) because this was going to be the most important purchase of the year.  I shopped vigorously online, read dozens of reviews, and finally decided on the OXO Good Grips Flexible Vegetable Brush.We've had it now for several months.  It is very comfortable to hold (even for people with giant freak hands like me), it does a good job of cleaning the potatoes, and best of all not one single bristle has even begun to flatten.  I no longer refuse to scrub my potatoes, so I don't think its stretching to say that this little brush has helped strengthen my relationship.  It really is fantastic, and I have nothing bad to say about it.  Totally worth the $8, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has to scrub vegetables.  Even if it eventually does flatten out on me, its already lasted at least 3x as long as any other brush I've tried.\n",

They had this exact same model and contrary to what people are saying here, it DOES NOT move a large volume of air.I'm not saying that people here are lying or work for Lasko, but maybe they have just never had 3 diff models to test side by side.  At the local store, they had the CFM ratings of each fan but this model wasn't listed, nor was any CFM rating found on the box.  It's CFM rating is probably low so the Lasko probably doesn't want to advertise it.Of the 3 models I tested, I kept the Feature Comforts model which moves about 3000 CFM of air.  I live in a 4000 sq ft home and bought these to flush out the hot air when I get home from work so I can cool the house w/AC faster.  I tested the fans by setting them up in the windows on the same wall and stepped back from the windows as far as I could till I could no longer feel the air being moved by each fan.The Lasko model pushed air about 7ft till I could no longer feel anything.  The Feature Comforts model pushed the air 29ft.  The Feature Comforts model also had the most uniform airflow w/o any \"dead spots\" near the center of the airstream.I would advise anyone to goto your local store and try the same, it costed me less than $70 to try the models I was interested in.  The only problem is the hassle of boxing up the ones that didn't perform well and the cost of gas for returning it.The Feature Comforts model number is 184705 and is an 18\" fan.  It's amazing that it can push 4x more air than the 20\" Lasko model.  Unfortunately, it's not on their website but it is available locally for only $24.Hopefully, Lasko will read this review and improve their fans and have an indepedent lab rate its CFM and put it on the box for educated consumers.\n",

      "Our experience with this corer/slicer has been the same as many reviewers here.The initial trick with this device is aiming so that it actually slices through the core, rather than to one side.  Since apples are seldom perfect, this sometimes requires a bit of cleverness.  If the core is missed, then a small paring knife may be needed to remove seeds, etc, from some of the slices.We have also noticed two other things noted by other reviewers:1.  The device doesn't always cut cleanly all the way through the bottom of the apple.  This is probably a function of the cutting surface.  Often it is necessary to pull the core and/or some of the segments through the device by hand.  It is better to grip each segment and pull it through, rather than try to push on the skin at the bottom, which could lead to cut fingers.2.  The white outer ring on ours has cracked where one of the blade \"spokes\" meets the ring.  So far this hasn't affected the unit's operation, but I am assuming that it will fail at that point some day.The good news is that Oxo stands behind its products, and I expect that if and when this unit fails, Oxo will replace it.All in all, a good choice for this purpose, even if not perfect.  It's still much faster than manually cutting apple slices, and probably safer.\n",

My kids have enjoyed apple ring snacks (smeared with peanut butter and sprinkled with granola) and baked apples with brown sugar!  My son has a habit of munching the apple through the core, but will not eat an apple that has been cut up.  This corer has been the perfect solution, as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.  Very sturdy, easy to use and a steal for the price!\n",

      "These are quite honestly the best measuring cups I have owned to date.  Unlike the others with problems having the handle bend, mine have been unaffected.  Perhaps its a simple solution of gripping more towards the 'cup' than at the far end of the handle, but not too much to ask to try and prevent the 'bending' from happening.  As with all OXO products, they are very well made, have a great non slip handle, and beleive it or not, having the sizes written in bright differing colors helps.  Overall very satisfied and would highly recommend.\n",

The plastic bowl is cracked and deteriorated, so I bought the new one.This item is loaded with problems, but here are the reasons you shouldn't get it:1) It's under powered.  The heating element doesn't approach the temp of the older one and you need hot oil to pop the corn properly.  This one cooks the kernels and many don't pop.2) The stirring arm is flimsy and cheap.  The old one had a bent design that followed the contour of the popper.  This one has a straight stirring arm so kernels get caught and the arm gets stuck.\n",

      "I love roast duck but no matter what I've tried I've never able to manage a juicy duck with crispy skin (the best part!!) in the oven.  Yesterday I used my Ronco rotisserie for the first time to cook a 7# (Maple Leaf Farms) duck and it was fantastic -- nice and juicy and every inch of skin was crispy.  For duck lovers, I rubbed it with paprika, used a very sharp knife to cut slits all over the duck so the fat could drain off (ducks are VERY fatty), put it on the spit, set the rotisserie for 1:45 (7 lbs x 15 min/lb) as recommended and then checked it with a meat thermometer when it shut off.  Internal temp was right where it should have been so I brushed on the orange sauce that comes with the duck. let it heat/rotate for another 7 minutes, let it rest for about 10 minutes, and then started carving.  Best duck I've ever had at home or in a restaurant!!!  (Surprisingly, leftovers brushed with orange sauce and reheated in my convection oven at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes were just as good today as yesterday's meal.)  A couple notes. I lined the drip tray and drip cover with aluminum foil and even though a lot of fat had been collected in both, clean-up was a breeze.  I sprayed the back reflector shield with Pam as others recommended and it came out scorched and black. Scrubbing it with a scouring pad did next to nothing so I sprayed it with Easy Off heavy-duty oven cleaner, put it in the rotisseries overnight and this morning it wiped clean, good as new!  I can't speak yet to the durability of this rotisserie but I highly recommend it to duck lovers everywhere.  (Sorry, Donald and Daisy :-)\n",

The Vic Firth French Rolling Pin is small, lightweight and easy to handle. It is probably best suited for a small person with small hands.Most pastry should be rolled with a light, but increasingly heavy, touch. This rolling pin allows that control, but the light weight requires more arm pressure to the finished product. For some, that could be a bit tiring.I like this pin and will keep it. But I would prefer that it be slightly thicker and heavier.\n",

      "I have had these for about 11 months now. I should mention that the manufacturer recommends hand washing and I do not have a dishwasher so this was not an issue for me.First impression was good. The metal is not thin and they are strong and hold their shape. The measurements were easy to read and were not mismarked (some reviewers mention receiving mismarked measurements).The INDIFFERENT: The little pour spouts on the side of the cups seem like a good idea but in actual application are 100% uselessThe GOOD: These nest into each other quite well. The elliptical shape allows for easier scooping from bags and jars. The clasp ring that holds them together makes it easy to remove/replace individual cups when needed.The BAD: I have already had one of the handles fall off the cup. I assume this is due to poor welding of the stainless. There is no warranty on the product and they are not available for purchase as individual cups so you have to buy a whole new set. Because of this, in my opinion, if one thing breaks I consider the entire set broken.What I expect is fair price that reflect the quality of the product as well as on time delivery. Amazon delivered quickly but the product quality was sub par for the price paid especially considering the inability to replace individual pcs.\n",

The design is so dramatic that a mere sprinkling of powdered sugar, cinnamon or cocoa is sufficient to decorate a finished cake.The pan is nicely non-stick (when sprayed with pan spray) and it is heavy, for even baking.
